=======

This project contains some of the content of my site, <https://www.tobymackenzie.com>.  My [tobymackenzie.com.site](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/tobymackenzie.com.site) project takes this content to turn it into web pages.

My blog posts are in here just as exports, generated by my [wp-to-markdown](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/wp-to-markdown.php) script.  Blog posts on the site are actually stored in and generated by WordPress.  I plan to fully move them here, but there is a lot of work to do for that.

This repo can serve as a sort-of mirror of my site, with the [home page here](/content/index.md) and the [list of all content here](/content).
