Jack the dog
=====

Jack the dog was first bought by Jamie and his then girlfriend Chelsea.  When Jamie moved to Seattle, he gave Jack to my parents and he became the family dog.  Jack was a small dachshund mix, black with brown highlights.

When young, Jack was very energetic.  When he was living with Jamie, there was a huge woods behind him that they would go to and Jack would zoom around.  He loved it.  He would go much faster than he looked like he could even up and down steep hills that would be slow for us humans.  When he moved to my parents, he lost this and had trouble with it.

Jack liked to go on hikes.  My dad did many hikes with him for many years.  In his last couple years of life, when I was spending more time at my parents', I went on many hikes with him as well.  He eventually slowed down in walking and wanted to go less and less far.

Jack loved to burrow under blankets.  He liked to laze on the couch, especially as he got older.  He also liked to lay in the hot sun.

As Jack aged, his joints ached.  He started having trouble getting up into beds, then cars and couches / chairs.  He would do this rocking motion fore and back until he would finally jump up or down.  He also would become weird mentally sometimes.  He seemed to walk confusedly in circles for a minute for instance.  His vision and hearing both faded.  Sometimes, he would do this weird backing up thing where it was like some invisible thing was in front of him.  It was often, but not always, in sunny spots.

Before his death, he had some time with a young [Duncan](/content/duncan.md).  Duncan was especially playful then and just wanted to play, but he played very rough.  After a couple times of Duncan pouncing on Jack, Jack would hide behind a chair or wherever he could find, just trying to stay away, and wouldn't come out until a half hour or more after Duncan left.

One day, he did his rocking motion to get down from my dad's recliner chair.  When he jumped down and landed on the wooden floor, his hind legs gave way beneath him and he fell flat.  He couldn't get up, so he just lay there.  I tried to massage his hips thinking it might help, but it didn't.  He pooped in place.  At my mom's insistence, I slid him onto a nearby rug to make it a bit softer for him.  My dad eventually came over and rolled him on his side.  After a bit, he started rocking his head back and forth and sort of coughing and biting like he had something in his mouth.  Then he expired, right in front of us.  Poor Jack.

Jack was a good dog.
