I like plants, especially flowers, and thus like gardens.  I also enjoy the activity of gardening.  I have some small flower gardens around my yard and have been continually trying to improve them, though they are a never ending battle.  I like native plants especially.  Some of my favorite plants in my garden are two small eastern redbud trees, a small creeping wintergreen plant, various coreopsis, and dead nettle.
