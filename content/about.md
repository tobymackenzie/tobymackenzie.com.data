I am Toby Mackenzie, a web developer of Northeast Ohio.

Places
-----------

I have lived in Northeast Ohio my whole life.  This has included Cleveland, Lakewood, Peninsula, Kent, Ravenna, and Cuyahoga Falls.  Accomodations have included houses, dorms, an apartment, and a mobile home.

School
-----------

I started kindergarden at Lincoln Elementary School, where I spent a delightful six years.  I attended Horace Mann Middle School for just one year before moving to the [Woodridge School District](http://www.woodridge.k12.oh.us/).  There I spent the rest of my grade school days.

I then attended [Kent State](http://www.kent.edu/index.cfm) for four and a half years, majoring in Hospitality Management.  I also minored in business and took some various other courses, including Computer Science, which I really liked.  After graduating, I spent several years working as a line cook. During this time, I was expanding my knowledge of various programming and web languages, and my plans changed from a future in the restaurant industry to a future in the web development industry.

Determining that I would need some sort of accreditation or/and experience before jumping into the industry, I began attending [Tri-C](http://tri-c.edu/) to see what they would offer me, where I stumbled upon the [eBusiness Management Program](http://www.tri-c.edu/programs/ebusiness/Pages/default.aspx).  It gave me a year long internship and a number of computer, business, and web related courses to take.  I have now graduated and have my second degree.

I no longer attend school, but have not stopped learning.  The web indusrty continues to expand and evolve.  There is more knowledge and more technologies and tools out there than any one person can learn and use.  I continue to expand my knowledge base and try to keep up with the current trends, tools, and techniques.  I read blogs, listen to podcasts, experiment and play, attend meetups and events, etc.

Occupations
-----------

My first job was at the [Winking Lizard Tavern](http://www.winkinglizard.com/data/content/), where I worked for just about 10 years.  I started as a busser and dishwasher, worked briefly as a host, and ended up in the kitchen working various stations.  It was a fun time, but it could be rough, especially in the busy summer.

Losing interest in the restaurant industry, I moved into the industry of one of my hobbies, build websites.  Concurrently with my stint at Tri-C, I worked as a web development intern at [RPM International](http://rpminc.com).  They are a large sealants and coatings company with many subsidiaries.  I worked on some of their company websites as well as a number of charity websites to which they donate hours and hosting.  I did front end development as well as some back end development in classic ASP and some database work with SQL Server.  It was a large change from the Winking Lizard.  I enjoyed working on sites there, especially when some of the more difficult programming or database query problems came up.

I now work at [Cogneato](http://cogneato.com), a small web development firm in Akron.  I started out mostly doing front-end development, cutting up layouts and converting them to HTML and CSS, but ended up just as much involved with back end development and server maintenance as the job has required.  The company uses a proprietary CMS to create and maintain websites for many businesses and organizations of varying sizes.

Hobbies
-------

I have always been interested in computers, and tend to spend a lot of time using them.  I also enjoy a number of outdoor activities, including cycling, running, hiking, and sailing.  I enjoy sports, especially dodgeball, but I have no one to play them with.  I like music, both to listen to and to play.  I played drums in concert and marching band in grade school and a rock band for about five years.  I now mainly am focused on playing keyboard for my own entertainment.  I like photography.  I have some interest in home design and operation, cars, and many other things.  I like to create things, improve things, learn things, and organize things.
