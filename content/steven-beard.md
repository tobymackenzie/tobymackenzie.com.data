Steven and I worked together on a project at the 2018 Cleveland GiveCamp.  Though new to the industry, he was motivated to contribute and willing to learn in a stack he hadn't worked with before.  I could tell he's driven to help others through his work.  I enjoyed working with him and helping him learn.
