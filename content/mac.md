Mac computers have been my primary computer since a young age.  I started with the Macs at the Tri-C computer labs that I played on while my Mom was working.  She eventually got a Mac SE at home, which I spent time playing on.  She continued to get Macs.  Eventually I got my own, staring with a 9500 180/MP tower (the first real multi-processor Mac).  I then moved to laptops, currently running a Macbook Air.  I have long been interested in moving to Linux though, and may eventually relegate the Mac to secondary status at some future point.
