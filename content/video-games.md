I've liked video / computer games from a young age, starting in the mid 80s.  I don't play them often or get as much enjoyment out of them anymore, but occasionally get in the mood and play, mostly the games from when I was young.  TI-99/4A, Mac, NES, Gameboy, Game Gear, SNES, and N64 are the primary systems I've played, enjoyed, and still have access to (some on emulation).

I have a tendency to like RPG games.  Some games I've particularly liked include:

- Asterax
- Bugs Bunny's Birthday Blowout
- Chrono Trigger
- Civilization II / III
- Cosmic Osmo
- Crystal Quest
- Dr. Mario
- Dragon Warrior
- Escape Velocity Override / Nova
- Final Fantasy / Adventure / Legend II / Legend III
- Manhole
- Maniac Mansion
- Monster Party
- Oregon Trail
- Secret of Evermore
- Secret of Mana
- SimAnt
- SimCity / 2000
- SimTower
- Super Mario Brothers 1, 2, 3, World, 64
- Tetris

Of those, my favorite is probably Chrono Trigger.
