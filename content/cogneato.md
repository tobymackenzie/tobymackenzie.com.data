[Cogneato](https://cogneato.com) is a small Akron web development firm.  I have worked there since 2010, my main job in my [web development career](/content/web-dev).  I have worked on over a hundred websites in some capacity in this time, as well as the CMS that the sites run on as well as the servers and other related activities.  If you are a small Akron-based or Northeast Ohio company, check them out.
