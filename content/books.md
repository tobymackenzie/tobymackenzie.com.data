I like reading books.  I have read a great many of them since I was young.  My favorite genre is [sci-fi](/content/sci-fi.md).  I go to a monthly sci-fi book club at my local library.  My favorite author may be Phillip K Dick.  I like a lot of books though.  Some books that I've especially liked or considered important to me include:

- Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and other Phillip K Dick books
- The Expanse series
- Slaughterhouse Five and other Kurt Vonnegut books
- Stranger in a Strange Land
- Brave New World
- Great Expectations
- Flowers for Algernon
- Bridge to Terabithia
- Elfquest series
- Calvin and Hobbes series
- The Phantom Tollbooth

Of course, there are so many others.
