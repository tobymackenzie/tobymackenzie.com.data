JavaScript is the active programming language of the web, for adding client-side behavior to websites.  It can also be used on the server with node.js and the like.  A lot of my JS experience has been using the [helper library jQuery](https://jquery.com/).  It can be a pain to work with sometimes, especially maintaining backward compatibility  I would love [a declarative equivalent](/content/blog/2022/11/23/idea-declarative-alternative-to-js.md) that enhances like CSS.
