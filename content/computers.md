I've been intersted in computers since a young age.  I like the web and have made a career building for it.  I have also played games on them and used them to manage and create information and documents of various types.  I have used Macs as my primary computers, but have also made use of Linux as servers as well as some desktop use.  I appreciate open source and formats.
