I've been interested in computers since a young age.  I like the web and have made a career building for it.  I have also played [games](/content/video-games.md) on them and used them to manage and create information and documents of various types.  I have long used Macs as my primary computers, but have also made use of Linux for servers as well as some desktop use.  I appreciate open source and formats.

My current primary computer is a Macbook Air, 13" 2020 Intel i3.  I bought it refurbished from Apple and it works plenty well for my development and normal needs.  I also have a Lenovo Yoga 7i of similar vintage that I regularly use, and some Raspberry Pis that see occasional use.
