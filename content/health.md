I have long tried to be on the healthier side of things generally.  After a health incident in 2021, I have taken a more significant focus on health.  Bad health can make everything else fade into unimportance.  I think that professional health care is very good at handling problems that can be easily seen and / or acute, but not very good at problems that are hidden and / or subtle.  It's also very expensive.  Most of our health problems must be managed by ourselves.  The internet provides a ton of information but it is quite varied and contradictory, hard to suss out what is right and what is applicable.
