I have long tried to be on the healthier side of things generally.  After a health incident in 2021, I have taken a more significant focus on health.  Bad health can make everything else fade into unimportance.  Most of the time, it is the most important thing.  I think that professional health care is very good at handling problems that can be easily seen and / or acute, but not very good at problems that are hidden and / or subtle.  It depends significantly on self-reporting, something I'm not good at.  It's also very expensive.  Most of our health problems must be managed by ourselves.  The internet provides a ton of information but it is quite varied and contradictory, hard to suss out what is right and what is applicable.

With my varied issues such as anxiety, back pain, and joint pain, I've come up with several phrases that help keep me on the right track:

- listen to the body
- relax
- be where you are / present
- slow down / don't rush
- balance on gravity
- find beauty here / seek positive
- limit input
- see the forest and the trees / fit the piece into the puzzle
- "the only thing to fear is fear itself" / "fear is the mindkiller"
- leave it for tomorrow
- let it flow / to the back of the mind
- don't carry it / let the past go ([monk carrying parable](https://asivanayoga.com/blogs/parables/the-two-monks-and-a-woman-at-the-river))
- don't police / don't judge
- don't worry too much until it happens
- "just because I'm in a two man novelty band doesn't mean it's all about poontang"

These depend on more detail that I've developed internally to have the meaning they do for me, and may not mean much or the same thing to others.  I will try to expand upon them at some point.  In general they're meant to apply most of the time, and are only needed when issues crop up or when circumstances are likely to lead to issues.
