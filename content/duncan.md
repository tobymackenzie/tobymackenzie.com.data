Duncan (Donut) is Jamie's current dog.  He is a pit mix from the shelter.  He likes to play with other dogs at the dog park and likes chewing things, especially a strange obsession with sticks.  Aside from a few incidents such as chewing a mattress topper, he has been pretty good about only chewing his toys.  He was more wily when younger but has gotten pretty good in general, except that he will run away from his yard sometimes.  His favorite game is keep away.  He can get very growly when playing and most dogs and humans shy away.  He also likes plain chase.  He doesn't really play much fetch.  He has plenty of energy and sometimes gets the zoomies.

Duncan has a nice brindle gray color and handsome demeanor that gets plenty of compliments.

My brother leaves him at my parents' house for several days a week while he goes to work.  I get to spend a fair amount of time with him when he's there.  I take him on walks and sometimes to the dog park.  

When young, on walks he would go after and sometimes bark at other people.  As he's gotten older, he's gotten much better on the walks and has liked them more.  When I'm at my parents in the morning, he expects a walk at the park.  He isn't really too interested in walks down my parents' street, much preferring a real hike in the park.  Sometimes he wants to keep going much longer than I want to, but also sometimes he doesn't want to go far, especially when the weather is cold or wet.  He likes to go much faster that I'd want to and often pulls me along.  He gets bored with going to the same place so I have to keep switching up where we go.

He's a good dog.
