Sadie is one of my former roommate's dogs, and was thus my roommate for a time.  She might be a pit mix, a yellowish color.  She loves chasing balls and is very ball driven, will watch them closely and run off like a shot when they're thrown.  She likes to cuddle.  She pees when she gets excited and used to do so often.  She would bark at [Indy](/content/indy.md) when he was doing something bad.  She often has a somewhat sad look.
