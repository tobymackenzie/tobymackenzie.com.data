Love is a thing in itself, but also, a collection of things.  Love can have many targets, each of which can consist of different parts of what love is.  There is love of spouse, parents, siblings, children, friends, neighbors, people, pets, places, songs.  Love can be broad or specific or anywhere in between, like loving music in general, a genre of music, or some specific songs.  Love can encompass a lot.  It can be a focus, or be hidden away.
