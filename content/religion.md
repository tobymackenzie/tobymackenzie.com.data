I am not what most people would consider religious.  I have been an agnostic or atheist depending on when you asked me.  But I do feel like there is a guiding energy in all things, more close to pantheism than monotheism.  It is good to follow this energy toward creating more good.

Religious texts, to me, are generally useful lies built around bits of truth, written by people under the influence of the good energy to push people of the time toward good, while also holding some of their own wants.  It's possible, even likely, that some bad people or wants slipped in among them.

It is my view that no person or thing is completely bad, nor is any completely good.  It is up to us to find the good in any one and thing, and to support that good and reject the bad.  All are our neighbors, and all are part of any good solution we can seek.  It is our job to see the bad in ourselves, and for it, atone.

All good religions tell us, at their core, to be excellent to each other.  The rest of their teachings and practices are showing us how to do that, to see the good, atone for the bad, and build something better.
