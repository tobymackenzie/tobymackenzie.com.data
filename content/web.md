Perhaps the most important part of the internet, the web provides information and other functionality accessible from most anywhere in the world.  I have taken up my career in working on sites on the web, using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL, Apache, Linux, and other tech to make websites and make the accessible.  I think it to be one of the most important modern inventions, particularly for its information sharing abilities.  I think it is good for regular people to be able to get and share lots of information.  There is, of course, the problem of too much info, especially junk info and disinformation, out there.  We must sift through this to get to the useful stuff.

The web is operated through a web browser.  Firefox is my preferred, mainly because of its open and independent nature compared to others while still being fully capable.  I like w3m most so far as a CLI web browser when I occasionally want a more simple view of the web.
