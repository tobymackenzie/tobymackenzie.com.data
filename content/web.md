Perhaps the most important part of the internet, the web provides information and functionality accessible from most anywhere in the world.  I think it to be one of the most important modern inventions, particularly for its information sharing abilities.  I think it is good for regular people to be able to get and share lots of information.  There is, of course, the problem of too much info, and especially junk info and disinformation, out there.  We must sift through this to get to the useful stuff.

As a [web developer](/content/web-dev), I have taken up my career in working on the web, using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL, Apache, Linux, and other tech to make websites.  I have worked on many sites and servers in my time.

One of my favorite parts of the web is the [indie web](https://indieweb.org/), sites by individuals that usually contain blogs and explore things from a personal perspective.

The web is operated through a web browser.  Firefox is my preferred, mainly because of its open and independent nature compared to others while still being fully capable.  I like w3m most so far as a CLI web browser when I occasionally want a more simple view of the web.
