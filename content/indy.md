Indy was my former roommate's dog, and thus also my roommate.  He was a black lab mix.  He was very energetic and wily in his youth.  He loved to run around with other dogs at the dog park.  In his later years he became less energetic and angry with other dogs.

He loved to take things and keep them away unless a human offered some food in exchange for them.  Once he bit me when I tried to grab something from him.  I bled and still have scars from the incident.  Thus I will always remember him at least for that.

Especially when he was younger, He got very excited when seeing other dogs and made some crazy vocalizations that often scared the other dogs.  He would try to escape his leash to get to them.  [Chester the dog](/content/chester) did not like his one meeting with Indy.

Indy was put down in January 2025 after falling and being unable to get back up.  He lost feeling in his hind legs.  There was a gradual loss of ability to get up into cars and the bed, for instance, in the years leading up to this.  He made it to around 12.5 years old.

He was a mostly good dog.
