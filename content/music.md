I like music, both to listen to and to play.  I like a variety of music, centering around classic rock, but also including punk, classical, 80s, 90s, grunge, jazz, etc.  I played percussion in school including marching band, and played drum set in a rock band in college called [The Yars](/content/yars.md).  I also play keyboard at a fairly simple level but enjoy it.

Some of my favorite musical entities or musical works long term have been:

- Béla Fleck and the Flecktones
- Jethro Tull
- Chrono Trigger Soundtrack

There are a great many others that I like though.  This list is a tiny portion of them, but some recent favorites or important ones include:

- …And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead - Worlds Apart, Source Tags
- Too Many Zooz
- Vivaldi - Four Seasons
- Ace of Bass
- Alanis Morissette
- Blondie - No Exit

- The Pretenders - The Isle of View
- Stranger Things Soundtrack
- Talking Heads
- Tchaikovsky - The Nutcracker Suite

I most often listen on my stereo in my car, usually from my phone using bluetooth.
