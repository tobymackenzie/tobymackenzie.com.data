I don't know why I didn't realize this before, but git project versions can be managed just with tags rather than needing to create a branch for each point version.  [Packagist](https://packagist.org) can go entirely by tags.  I had been creating point version branches because [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/branches) does, but that's really only needed if you need to continue updating a previous version.  It's overkill for small, one person projects.  With a tag available, it wouldn't be hard to create a branch later anyway if needed.
