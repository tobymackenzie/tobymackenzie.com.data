[Symfony 3.0 has finally been released](http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-3-0-0-released).  I hadn't even noticed for almost a week.  It took some time, but I've updated [my boilerplate](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/Symfony-Initial) and related bundles to use it.  I then updated [my site](https://www.tobymackenzie.com).  I haven't delved too far into 3 yet, but I like the new directory structure and profiler / dev toolbar.
