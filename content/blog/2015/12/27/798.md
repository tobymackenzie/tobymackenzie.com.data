I got PHP 7 working locally finally.  It worked for CLI just fine when I first installed it soon after its initial release, but it wasn't working with Apache.  I've been upgrading every once in a while and finally, today, it worked.  Now I just have to wait until [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/) supports it until I can start playing with it for my own site.  At work, though, I'm still stuck back in PHP 5.3 land because of needing to support some old sites.
