House fire down the street
==========================

To continue with my fire theme (see [Van fire](/content/blog/2015/05/17/van-fire.md)), I was awoken around 0500 to the sound of some yelling and then some fire trucks.  I couldn't see any fire or smoke from my bedroom window, but could see the trucks and firefighters and neighbors outside.  I could hear some talking and at one point chopping and breaking glass.  There were so many fire trucks with flashing lights that a red glow came through the curtain, reminding me of a certain Seinfeld episode.  They took up like half the block parked along the street.  One firetruck parked right in front of our house.  They were there for a couple hours probably and kept me awake for at least that long (I often have trouble falling asleep).  The event got [a brief blurb and video on the channel 5 website](http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/cleveland-metro/cleveland-firefighters-battle-house-fire-on-west-189th-street-early-monday).
