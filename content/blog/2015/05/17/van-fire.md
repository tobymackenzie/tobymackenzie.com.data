Van fire
========

On my way home from my brothers, I saw a van on fire.  Really on fire.  The whole thing was enveloped, the van itself looking like a dark skeleton trapped within.  The flames would sometimes jump to at least twice the height of the vehicle or flow across the lane width beside it.  Firefighters were around it spraying away.  The flames would fluctuate out and in, though always completely covering the van.  This was on 480 West.

I witnessed another fire related incident recently as well.  I saw a large plume of smoke on my way home from work.  I was on 77 North and it looked to be a ways away.  I had seen smaller plumes before and had wondered what they were, but never investigated.  That day though, I had nowhere to be and was in my car, so I decided to find it.  I just drove in its general direction until I got close enough to it.  It was on the east side of Cleveland.  The traffic around it was terrible and it was really slow going in its vicinity.  I didn't get the best view of it, but I did drive down the roads adjacent to it and saw the huge, rolling, multicolored plume of smoke billowing from pretty close and got brief glimpses of the flames and possibly the building.  I saw streams spraying into the smoke and flame.  The traffic was bad enough that I got my fill looking at it trying to get out of the traffic jam.
