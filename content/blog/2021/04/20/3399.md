I found myself needing to get the path to the current script and its directory in a local Node JS script recently.  In Common JS scripts, that is available by `__filename` or `__dirname` globals, but it isn't available by the same means in ES modules.  Instead, there is [`import.meta.url`](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_import_meta_url), which can be used to get at the directory name if needed, like:

``` js
const __filename = import.meta.url.replace(/^file:[\/]+/, '/');
const __dirname = __filename.split('/').slice(0, -1).join('/');
```
