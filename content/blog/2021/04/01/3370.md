After weeks of fairly solid spring-like weather, mother nature decided to give us some snow for April Fools Day.<!--more-->  Not just a dusting, but a few inches, though it was pretty fluffy and didn't stick to the roads.  I thought we were fairly comfortably into spring, but I guess not quite.  I think it's stayed below freezing all day.  Hopefully the blooming bulbs and sprouting plants aren't hurt by this.
