I went for a nice Easter hike at the Hampton Hills trail area today.<!--more-->  I've been mostly staying at home since my Covid shot, but needed to get out of the house.  I'm not fully recovered from the vaccine, and felt a bit weak on the hike.  At first I felt like I would only be able to do the short loop, but I went a little slower and drank water occasionally and ended up doing the full loop.

There were plenty of people out, plenty of "Hi"s passing each other.

I started with a hoodie and a long sleeve over a t-shirt, but ended up shedding to the base layer.  Definitely a warm day, in the vicinity of 70Â°F.  Back to spring weather.
