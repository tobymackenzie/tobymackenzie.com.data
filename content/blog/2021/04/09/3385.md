I went outside after work to sit and enjoy the nice 80Â°F weather, but the sky was gray.  Within minutes, the wind really started to kick up and a slight drizzle started.<!--more-->  Instead of sit, I went to check the state of my bulb plants.  Going toward the front, I saw an envelope in my neighbor's yard and assumed the wind had blown some trash.  As I rounded the front, I saw some more envelopes in my garden and a flyer sticking out of my mail slot.  Apparently, the mail wasn't stuck in far enough and got caught by the wind.  I'm glad I chose that time to check on my bulbs.  Another couple minutes and the rain started coming down.
