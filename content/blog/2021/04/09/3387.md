Many of my crocus flowers were damaged in the snowfall of last week and wilted away.<!--more-->  Some of the others vanished soon after, so there aren't many left.  There are plenty of daffodils now though, and some grape hyacinths are finally blooming.

I mowed my front lawn for the first time this year a few days back, and I must've gotten too close to some of the bulb plants.  Looks like I cut a few.  I guess that's a risk when planting them under the grass.  Hopefully they get enough light to survive, if not grow back and flower again.  I may have to do something to mark their location better when I mow, like temporarily put some stakes sticking up.  I may end up with some circle clumps of tall grass for a while.
