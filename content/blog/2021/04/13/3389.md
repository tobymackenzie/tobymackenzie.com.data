I had another health incident yesterday.  It kind of makes me feel like I'm dying.<!--more-->  During it, of course, but also the affects afterward and more generally with the gradual increasing frequency of the occurrences.  It forces me to focus on the more important things, and makes a lot of things seem silly, yet it makes it difficult to do much.  Now that I have my first covid shot and have the next one in a week or so, hopefully I'll be able to get back into the doctors and try to figure things out.

We need to work on getting Star Trek-like medical sensing technology.  So much of our medical system works based on self-reporting, which is quite limited, especially for many of these chronic problems.  Our sensors are expensive, slow, and limited.
