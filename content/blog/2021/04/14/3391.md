I planted some flowers in my garden today, and discovered a large number of acorns in my bags of soil and soil enhancer.<!--more-->  Some chipmunks must be living in my garage and stashing some of the acorns I conveniently set outside for them.  The acorns were piled and buried in the bags, and had really started to root, some probably six inches long and intertwined.  I don't know if chipmunks eat them once they root.  Anyway, they were so intermixed with the soil that I couldn't just pull them out by themselves, rather needing to grab clumps of soil and then pull out any acorns as I sifted the soil into its destination.  There still are a lot left in there, which I will have to deal with as I continue planting.  And maybe I'll have to put more effort into keeping the chipmunks out of the garage.
