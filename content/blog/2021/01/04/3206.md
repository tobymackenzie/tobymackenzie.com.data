Yay Browns, going to the playoffs for the first time in a long time.<!--more-->  Of course, they weren't looking all that strong against the Steelers with key players out.  They did quite well at first but then the Steelers seemed to figure them out and almost came back.  Since the two teams play again for the first round of the playoffs and it's single elimination, I don't expect the Brown's to get past them unless they can get their important missing players and coaches back, get some real practice time, figure some things out, and get enough players "in the zone" for enough of a game to pull it off.
