I made it through a week of jury duty without having to go in, as usual.<!--more-->  In fact, none of the groups or colors had to go in this week.  I seem to get jury duty maybe every four years, but have only had to go in once that I recall.  That time I went in on a Monday, watched a video with a big group of people about the importance of jury duty, and then got sent home after like an hour because the case got plead out or something.

I'm fairly glad.  I don't think I'd make a good juror.  My anxiety and shyness would no doubt both become problems sitting in front of a courtroom and arguing the case at the jury table.  I'm trying to limit stress in my life, and just the possibility of having to go in had added some since I got the notice.  Now, one less thing to worry about.
