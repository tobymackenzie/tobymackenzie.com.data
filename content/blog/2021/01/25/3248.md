Well, after two great games, the Cavs did absolutely terribly against the struggling Celtics, losing by 38 points.<!--more-->  Hurts my optimism for the team.  They have a lot of potential, but they couldn't get going offensively or defensively for an entire game.  They lost every quarter.  Of course, the refs helped the Celtics early in the game and four of the starters got very short minutes, so it was mostly the bench, but still, the bench was looking good the previous two games at least, and should've been better than that.  Hopefully they can figure out what went wrong and get back on track.
