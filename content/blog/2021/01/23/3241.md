Yay again, Cavs, beating the Nets a second time in a row.<!--more-->  Nets were without KD this time, but the Cavs won much more soundly, with no OT required and both teams emptying their bench near the end of the fourth.  Cavs finally got Garland back, though he played reduced minutes.

I wore another Cavs shirt today.  I tried to do some exercise for the fourth quarter, but felt some pain / fatigue or something that I just couldn't push through.  I wonder if I'm getting sick.
