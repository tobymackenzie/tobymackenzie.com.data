It seems the WiFi in my [aging 2009 Macbook](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/specs/macbook-core-2-duo-2.26-white-13-polycarbonate-unibody-late-2009-specs.html) is dying.<!--more-->  It's been having problems connecting or even turning on for a while, but now it's happening almost every time it's used where the WiFi device will stop working and will either just not show any networks to connect to or display as off entirely, without being able to turn back on.  Only a restart will bring it back up.  Sometimes it will only last a few minutes of use.  Just today, it started to not work at all after reboot sometimes, and once showed a message that no WiFi device was installed.  Luckily I'm in the process of moving to newer devices.
