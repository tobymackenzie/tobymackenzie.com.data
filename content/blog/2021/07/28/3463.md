I accidentally made a 147GB file filled with `grep` output and almost filled up my hard drive.<!--more-->  I'm switching the user name on my Mac, and wanted to try to replace all spots referencing the old location in the user's folder.  I thought I'd just grep them into a file that I could work my way through, like:

``` bash
(find /Users/newuser -type f -exec grep '/Users/olduser' {} \+;) > results.txt
```

There are apparently a lot more references than I could've imagined.  Or maybe it was a problem that the output file was in the user folder, with grep perhaps reading a file in such a way that it will read in changes as they're added.  It was taking a really long time to run.  I assumed it was just the reading of the files causing a problem, but then I suddenly got a warning that I was running out of disk space and should clear unneeded files.  I quickly killed the process and removed the file once I realized what happened.  I'm not sure if all those references will cause a problem.  Maybe I should figure out some `sed` magic and just replace them all in place, but I'm not sure if that will cause a problem either.
