[Atom](https://atom.io/) (text editor) lost a bunch of unsaved work I had in it.<!--more-->  I've gotten so used to its ability to automatically store unsaved changes when quitting that I've come to depend on it, with a bunch of "files" without files attached to them, like draft blog posts, thoughts, code ideas, plans for projects, temporary storage of passwords, etc.  Some of them have been sitting for years.  I luckily have migrated to a new computer recently, so I can start up the old one to get some of it back, but not all.  I think I need a new system.

There have been a few occasions where Atom has somehow misbehaved when quitting and all of these files just disappeared, but that was generally before I started using its projects system for everything with the [project-manager plugin](https://atom.io/packages/project-manager), where reopening the saved project would almost always bring things back.  Not this time.  It's been a while since I've had the issue.

I have no idea where it actually stores this stuff, so I have no idea if they're sitting somewhere on disk for recovery or not.  I haven't been able to find it looking around with `grep`.  I'm probably going to want to avoid depending on that feature anymore.  Everything with a file from now on, session store only for crashes and what not.  It was very convenient, but obviously not safe.
