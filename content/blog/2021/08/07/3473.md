I spent $900 to get my car's AC running again.<!--more-->  It stopped running several years ago.  I'm finding it more difficult to deal with the heat with my health problems, so I decided I wanted to go for it even though it was expensive.  It has made quite a difference.

I had paid Cascade $100 to test and refill it a while back.  They just said that a cap was loose, tightened it, and refilled it.  Thing is, they were the ones that had refilled it last, like a year previously, when they were working on something else and charged me $10 as an add on to refill.  That first time it lasted it about 3 days; the second, it didn't work for a minute.  So this time I looked elsewhere.  Mr. Tire wanted $1200 to replace the compressor plus evacuate and refill.  Rad-air wanted $900 to do the condenser and refill.  I went with them and it's working so far.

It blows nice and cold, quickly.  It seems to cycle on and off kinda frequently, but so far that hasn't been a problem.  Let's hope the cool air lasts.  Cars really build up heat, and sometimes I can think I'm alright when I'm really getting overheated.  The cool air can feel good even when I'm not feeling too hot.
