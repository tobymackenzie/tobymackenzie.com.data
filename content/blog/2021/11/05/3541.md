My furnace stopped working.  Luckily this house has a lot of thermal mass (brick) and is well insulated, plus has newer windows.<!--more-->  It got down to 69Â°F with like 8 hours of no furnace.  I have two electric heaters going, and I boiled two pots and a kettle for good measure.  Reminds me of my mobile home days, where I did that stuff a lot, except it was much colder because it was poorly insulated and drafty.  Here it feels pretty good.

The furnace is a Carrier throwing code 31 for pressure valve.  It seems that can mean a lot of things.  There's a drainage pipe that was making some gurgling noises.  I took the lines and condensate trap leading to it apart and rinsed the trap out in the sink.  A bunch of gunk came out.  I'll have to see if I can figure out a way to clean it better, and then see if that fixes the furnace.  That will be for tomorrow though.
