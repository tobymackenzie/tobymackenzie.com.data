Last Sunday was the first real snow of the year.  It was also a cold, blustery day.<!--more-->  I went on a hike with my dad when the snow was more of graupel and wasn't sticking.  It was a nice hike through the forest at Oak Hill, but it was cold enough that we didn't go too long.  Later the snow starting coming down harder, some big fluffy flakes, and started sticking.  It ended up at an inch or two of solid coverage.  It looked really nice and was pleasant watching from inside the warm house.
