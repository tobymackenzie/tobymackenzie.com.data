First day of snow sticking to the roads.<!--more-->  Didn't start till after dark though and after I was done driving for the day.  I did go out for an evening walk and my shoes got wet.  The snow plow came down the road after I had gotten back.

The snow is sticking to the ground and to the plants and trees.  It looks nice.  A beauty that will help make it through the cold of winter.
