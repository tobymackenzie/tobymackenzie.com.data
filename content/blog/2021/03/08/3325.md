I woke up in the middle of the night last night fighting a strong feeling of sickness.  I think it was just a stomach bug.<!--more-->   I had nausea, aches, and diarrhea.  I had a bit of a feeling of something in the back of my throat.  Most prominent, though, was an inability to get myself to a comfortable temperature. I woke up feeling too hot and then found myself swinging to feeling too cold, and back and forth.  I turned up the thermostat and went and lay on the couch, adjusting my blanket until I felt alright.

I had eaten some restaurant food that evening and the day before.  That evening was Chin's, and I ate a little too much.  The previous day, lunch, was Mexican at the one on Exchange.  Could've been from one of those, or possibly something I made at home.

I felt mostly fine today, though I did have diarrhea for a while and my appetite wasn't quite normal.  I took it easy though.  I cancelled joining my parents for dinner to be on the safe side.  I will watch closely tomorrow and the next couple days to make sure it's not covid or something.
