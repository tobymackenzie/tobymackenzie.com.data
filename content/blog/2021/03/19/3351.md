I had a reuben and a shamrock shake this evening to belatedly celebrate St Patricks Day.<!--more-->  I had the reuben at the Winking Lizard, at which I don't believe I had dined in since before the pandemic.  I was lucky enough to get the last one they had.  No Slymans, but still good.  The shamrock shake was from McDonald's, which I rarely visit except for my annual shamrock shake pilgrimage.  Also good.
