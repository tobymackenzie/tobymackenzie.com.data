I guess Akron has moved its Utilities Business Office (where water sewer trash bills are paid) seven minutes farther away.<!--more-->  I went to the old spot only to find the old drop slots removed and a sign mentioning the new address.  It used to be pretty near the Cogneato office, so I could pick up my paycheck, drop off my utility bill, and stop at the bank to deposit my check fairly quickly.  Maybe I should just give in and pay for the stamp to mail it or pay the fee to do it online.
