Took advantage of this great weather to hike the Dogwood this evening.  Was a lot less muddy than last time except for one stretch.<!--more-->  There was no ice on the trail this time, but the part that was iciest last time was muddiest this time.  One spot, I sunk my entire shoe in, which was fully coated when I pulled it out.  A woman was approaching to pass at the time and she said "oof" twice as she observed my missteps.  She directed me to a dry path beside the trail.

I had meant to bring my boots.  I grabbed them and set them aside while I was getting ready to go, planning to wear my shoes to the car, then switch once I got to the trail.  But then I totally forgot them.  So now I have muddy shoes to clean in addition to muddy boots (from last time).

As I approached my car after the hike, crossing the field, there was a nice warm breeze and kind of that feeling as a warm rain is approaching.  It felt about perfect.
