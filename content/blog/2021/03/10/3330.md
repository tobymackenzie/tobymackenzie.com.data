I'm glad it's warmed up again and quite spring-like.<!--more-->  I've sat out on my deck several times for lunch break and after work.  Did some yard work, cleaning up the mess that the roofers left.  I did some work on my garden Sunday fixing some plastic edging stuff that had fallen over; took a lot more work to dig a gap in the slightly frozen ground than I expected, but I got it done well enough for the moment at least.  Also raked some leaves out of the ground cover in the back in hopes of helping the bulbs I planted there.  And relatedly, I've got some bulbs popping up.  I've only seen a small number of the over 100 that I planted last fall, but I'm hopeful these are just the early risers.
