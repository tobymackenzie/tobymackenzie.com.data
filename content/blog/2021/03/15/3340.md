I've signed up for the virtual [Stir Trek](https://stirtrek.com/) this year.<!--more-->  Virtual is probably better for me anyway:  I've had trouble with the lack of sleep needing to drive down to Columbus so early in the morning in the past.

It has only a single track instead of the like 8 they normally have, so there's a lot less talk options, but at least there's no struggle to choose.

I'm not sure what sort of streaming service they'll be using.  Hopefully my internet (T Mobile) is sufficient.
