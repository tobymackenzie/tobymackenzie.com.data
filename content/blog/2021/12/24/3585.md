Merry Christmas Eve.<!--more-->  I spent part of my day day preparing gifts and sending Christmas cards (yes, they'll get there after Christmas).  I also spent several hours in this 50-some degree weather mulching leaves.  I was supposed to prepare my pecan tassies for tomorrow, but I figured that I'm not going to get weather like this again until spring.

I had pierogis at my parents' for dinner.  I watched a quarter of *It's a Wonderful Life* with my mom before heading home.  I didn't feel like watching all the way through, plus I was hoping to start on the tassies tonight.  That didn't happen though.

I watched the second season Christmas episode of Community, a good episode.  I also caught the ending of *It's a Wonderful Life*.  I'd kind of like to watch some other Christmas things, but there's not a lot of time.

Tomorrow is Christmas.  Having a five person, small family dinner instead of our usual bigger family event because of covid.  I'm hoping I can prepare make the tassies better than last year and without rushing.
