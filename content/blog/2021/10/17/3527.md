I went to Country Maid and got some ice cream today, chocolate peanut butter in a waffle cone.<!--more-->  It was an odd day to choose for my first visit of the year, being below 60 degrees at the highest, but I wanted to get there at least once this year.  I was cold sitting out on the bench eating, and in fact started coughing on the way home, but that passed once I warmed up, and it was worth it.  There weren't many people there and I was the only one sitting on the benches.  I said waffle cone but had wanted cake cone.  Oh well.  I got my dad a pint of their mint chocolate chip, which is probably my preferred choice there as well.
