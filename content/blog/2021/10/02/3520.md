I hiked the Dogwood trail for the first time since at least April, when my health had taken a turn for the worse.<!--more-->  I've been feeling good lately and felt up to the longer loop than my normal walks.  It was a pleasant hike.  I took it a little slower to make sure I didn't overextend myself.  It started out a little cool but warmed up as I went, so I shed my hat and jacket and probably could've shed my hoodie too.  The trail was very dry.  Worms seemed to be wanting to journey across, and many were looking pretty dry as well.
