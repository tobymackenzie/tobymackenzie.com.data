The first full day of fall was appropriately cold, not getting above mid 50s and being wet and windy.<!--more-->  I turned on my furnace for the first time since spring.  My house got down to 71.  It had been that low before but it just feels colder when it's colder outside.  I also wore my long-john top, bringing me to four layers.  That may become the norm as it gets colder, assuming I continue to have problems with cold intolerance.
