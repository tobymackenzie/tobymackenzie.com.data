My hike on the Dogwood trail today was quite a slog through mud and ice.<!--more-->  The mud was the stick-to-the-boots kind and slick in places.  The ice was mostly thin and soft and could be kicked with heel or toe to make footholds as I went, but still could be hard and slick in places.  I only saw one other person on that trail, who was somehow managing to run it without any sign of sliding or falling.
