The installation of a new version of nodejs via MacPorts took nearly two hours.<!--more-->  MacPorts builds everything from source, so it's expected to take a long time, but that's especially long.  It's gotta be several times as long as any other single packages that I remember.

MacPorts apparently requires uninstalling the previous version before updating to a new major version with node.

I did this all because it was [becoming a pain to install any packages](/content/blog/2021/02/26/3310.md) with node 8.  Hopefully node 15 lasts a while so I don't have to do this again for a while.
