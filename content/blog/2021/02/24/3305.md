I successfully switched my regular Firefox profiles back from Developer Edition to regular edition by waiting for the version to update.<!--more-->  I had [accidentally opened the regular profiles in Dev Edition](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2021/02/03/3261/) a couple weeks back, and they wouldn't open in regular edition, saying they can't be switched to a lower version.  So I disabled automatic updates in Dev Edition and waited for the regular edition update to version 86 to be released.  It worked.
