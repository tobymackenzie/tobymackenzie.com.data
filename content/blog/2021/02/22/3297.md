I feel like Larry Nance Jr. is proving himself the <abbr title="most valuable player">MVP</abbr> of the Cavs by their terrible performance since his injury.<!--more-->  They were looking really good and had just come off two good victories over the Nets when he jammed his wrist in the first quarter of a game that they went on to lose miserably.  Since, he's been out all but four games, and in those four he wasn't playing at his normal level.  He led the league in steals before then but only got one total in those games.  They've only won two of sixteen in the time since his injury.
