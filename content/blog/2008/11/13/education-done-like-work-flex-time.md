Education done like work flex-time
==================================

*** reasons
	scheduling classs around work, home, and other parts of life can be very difficult
		especially when a rigid schedule week after week is required and
		required classes frequently have few available scheduling options
		long, fixed terms mean students must plan in advance and be scheduled for months

*** possible implementation characteristics
* semesters
no more fixed semesters or similar fixed periods
students attend lectures, office hours, etc. whenever they want
	each lecture, etc is offered at one of many pre-scheduled times
		students can pick and choose which time they want to go
		times and frequency chosen based on previous demand
student must attend a certain set of lectures, plus perhaps some from an optional collection
can take as long as they want to complete a course
take tests/evaluations/projects when they feel they are ready
	tests given in a testing center where they can be taken any time
		monitored, students from many classes take tests at once
		much harder than current tests to give flexibility in determining competency
			getting 50% of the questions right probably good target normal grade
	one on one type evaluations scheduled with prof for most convenient time
		at least as important as tests
		profs spend time with student determining their capabilities
	projects are like homework, but larger and with a more defined purpose
		projects last a certain duration, must be finished by a due date
			some longer and bigger, some short and small
		groups projects will require students signing up, running once a quota is reached
competencies rather than grades
	not fixed
		students can keep going until they achieve desired/required level of competency
	profs decide competency based on tests, projects, evaluations, time spent with in class and office-hours
	many profs involved, whole department perhaps		
no homework per se normally
	in class, supervised work only most of the time
	perhaps some courses will have some continuity between some lectures with coursework given between
		required to be taken in a certain order
		should be rare
	projects will be the majority of work done outside of class
Office-hours/tutoring
	Some students obtain and undertand information in certain classes very easily while other students need a lot of help.  
	Part of profs time will be spent in an office hours / tutoring like teaching methodology where students are encouraged to seek assistance from the profs
		in a larger capacity setting than an office.  
			An entire class should be able to show up and be handled in this setting.  
	Possible student activities would be private study with occasional questions to prof or longer discussions with prof about certain points.
