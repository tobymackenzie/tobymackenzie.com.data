Another mouse
=============

There was another mouse in my house, removed yesterday.

Over the summer I had occasionally heard some mouse-like noises, especially more recently.  But I didn't see any signs, such as mouse poop and chewed up food.  On Monday I saw very sure signs, starting with the same scurrying past my bedroom door tiny brown furry thing that had alerted me to the presence of a mouse in the past.  I didn't want to alert Dwight, as I wasn't sure how he'd take it or what he'd want to do about it.  But as I was trying to sleep that night, the mouse kept chewing on something.  I couldn't sleep, so I repeatedly went into the kitchen searching for him.  I pulled off some wall/cupboard material in my search.  He finally stopped chewing after awhile, at least long enough for me to fall asleep, but I did set up one of my live traps from before.

He wasn't there  in the morning when I awoke.  There were no signs of him.  When I came home from work though, i heard a scratching/gnawing similar to the sound from the previous night.  He was not chewing on my house though, but on the trap.  I had him captured.   When Dwight came home I showed him.  He was not especially, though slightly, scared of the dirty little thing.

I drove him to the park.  I tried to take some photos with my new macro lens, but was unable to get anything good.  He disappeared quickly.
