Internship
==========

It looks like I've got an internship for the eBusiness Managment program I've recently begun at Tri-C.  It will be involving web development, which was my primary interest in going to Tri-C.  RPM International is the company, a multi-national conglomerate mainly focused on coatings and sealants, including Rustoleum.  The main company sort of owns many smaller companies, and it has web people to build web sites for these smaller companies.  The company also does a lot of charity work, including helping non-profit group make web sites.  I will be learning while helping RPM's web people.

The company uses some Visual Basic and ASP stuff along with Microsoft's SQL Server, so I will be learning those.  I've never used them before, coming from a PHP MySQL background.  But the concepts are all the same, and the syntax and what not involved will be very good to learn.  I will also learn much more complex and sophisticated things than I've been able to do thus far.  It's been slow going learning on my own.

This will be my second actual job ever.  I'm going to continue at the Winking Lizard for a while, but reduce my hours.  The internship is 3 days a week, and I'll probably end up with that at the Lizard as well.  It will be six days with no chance of overtime, but I'm fine with that given the circumstances.  Once school starts, I'll probably leave the Lizard completely so I can focus fully on the eBusiness program.  It'll be nice to finally be free of that place.  It's been rough going there every day for so long.
