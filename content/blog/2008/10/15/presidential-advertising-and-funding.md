Presidential Advertising and Funding
====================================

The advertisements on the TV and radio and the costs associated are crazy and huge, and one item that helps prevent smaller parties from entering the political game.  The money for these adverts coming primarily from donations, these donations sources have become a large point of contention.

I suggest that we eliminate all advertising by campaigners in these traditional advertising mediums.  All other forums of communications that are currently used would then be expanded in power.  Speeches and appearances, campaigners, candidate websites, and the debates should all be given more power.

The debates in particular need to be improved to allow more even representation of competing candidates and their ideas.  Each candidate should be timed during the debate for how much they've said.  This includes words spoken during or interrupting others' speech.  At the end, during their final statements, the other candidates should be given the time to even out their total speaking time.  And the presidential debates should always include at least one third party candidate, the most popular probably.  This will bring in an additional voice to attempt to break up the polarization in the discussion between only two voices.

Both the costs of campaigning and the needs to receive all that money through donations must be reduced significantly.  All that money could potentially be used for better purposes.

Other mediums should be better at providing information than the more stagnant campaign adverts on TV and radio.
