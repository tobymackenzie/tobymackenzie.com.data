T-Mobile is being annoying, requiring a debit card or bank routing number to get an auto-pay discount on their "post-paid" plans.<!--more-->  They've had a number of data breaches, including this year, so it's a little bit worrying giving them access to my bank account.  I begrudgingly switched it to my debit card, which at least is through VISA, so may give me some protection if it is hacked.
