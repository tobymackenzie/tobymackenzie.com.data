I found a tick biting me on Tuesday.  This seems to have become an annual occurrence the last several years.<!--more-->  It was on my shoulder / bicep region.  Just noticed a small bump when I was about to take a shower.  It was really locked on there, and as I pulled it, it pulled my skin out until it finally let go.  No mark at all, luckily.

Strangely, that same night, I was reading my e-reader, sitting in a chair in the house, with it dark and the front-light of the reader on, when suddenly a tick made its way onto the edge of the screen, possibly drawn by the light.  I assume it had to have been on me, but I hadn't been outside for several hours and not especially near woods or fields then.  Not sure if it had bit me or not, but no signs of it.
