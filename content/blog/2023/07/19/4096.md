Finally, after almost a week since my stings, they're no longer itching so bad.<!--more-->  They do still itch, but it's more like a mosquito bite level of itch.  It had been quite strong.  A rash had formed that was getting worryingly dark red, but it has faded away almost completely and only spots where the sting must've occurred are still noticeable.  I'm quite glad, and want to avoid getting stung again.
