Today, I took the longish walk to my polling location and voted.<!--more-->  Passed by the much closer polling location that I got to vote at once.  It was a fairly nice morning, though just slightly cold for me without my jacket.

A number of the candidates were unopposed, so I didn't vote for them unless I particularly wanted to.  I did vote for Shammas Malik, since he was from my ward, and I wanted to ensure he beat out the write-in spot that was the available alternative.  I voted for all the issues: abortion, marijuana, developmental disability funding.  I believe all my candidates and issues won.

Voting is important and Ohio voters spoke.  I'm sure the government will do their best to not listen though.

The church I voted at had two signs advocating particular school board candidates in their tree lawn.  Not sure if polling places are supposed to be able to do that, but I guess it doesn't matter too much.
