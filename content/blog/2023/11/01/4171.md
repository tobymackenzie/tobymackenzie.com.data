First snow of the year.  A couple inches on the ground and branches, paths and roads are clear.<!--more-->  It looked pretty nice this morning.  Mid-afternoon now and it's melted from the trees and melting from the ground.

The salt trucks were dumping salt selectively around Akron yesterday.  Seemed pretty early for it, but the roads otherwise might've been a bit icy before the sun came up.
