This fall has been very nice, seasonal, colorful, pleasant.<!--more-->  I feel like recent years, leaves had gone quick and not a bunch at once.  This year there's been a lot of color and it's been lasting.  Leaves have been falling slowly, pleasantly, continuously.  It has felt good, especially when the sun shines.  This recent snow may hasten the end, so I've got to enjoy it while I can.

No more bugs, not much lawn mowing.  Have a few gardening things to finish up before winter.  Will want to mow the growth around my yellow-jacket ground nest once they stop coming up for more than a few days.  Will have plenty of leaf raking, blowing, mulching to do soon, but I can let it sit a while.  The big oak in the back that produces most of my leaves still has a lot to go.
