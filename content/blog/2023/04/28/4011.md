Today, when running Vagrant on my Mac, I was greeted with a message "Vagrant will damage your computer", which blocked it from running.<!--more-->  Apparently, there was some CircleCI data breach, which caused [HashiCorp to revoke the signing certificate](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/13177506317203-Security-Alert-HashiCorp-Response-to-CircleCI) for their binary, leading to the error.  With the [help of StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76107976/vagrant-will-damage-your-computer-macos-v12-monterey-13132), I just had to reinstall and was back in business.
