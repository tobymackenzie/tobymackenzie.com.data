Today, I missed on Wordle and broke my streak.  I had been at 160-something on my way toward my max streak of 195.<!--more-->  I had thought I'd never get that high again, and obviously didn't, but was getting hopeful as I approached it.  Back to 0 again.

I had two green letters after the third word, got one more on the 4th, but didn't get any more after that.  Too many options for only trying two letters each turn.  Joker.
