Finally got some rain after several weeks without.  We really needed it.  It had been getting to borderline drought conditions.<!--more-->  The grass was getting brown.  Water levels in ponds were getting very low.  I was having to water garden plants quite frequently, especially the seed.  I put in a lot of seed this year, and some hasn't come up and some have died, though overall they're looking pretty good, if shorter than they oughta be by this point.  The ground has been very dry, which made digging in my heavy clay soil quite hard.  Even the worms I was finding looked dry.  There has also been smoke coming from wildfires up north.  Hopefully the rain helps with those.  We got around an inch of rain today and should have a few more days of rain coming, hopefully enough to get us back where we should be.
