Today was super windy.  I went to enter my parents' door.  Knowing it was windy, I held the storm door handle while opening the main door.<!--more-->  Lucky I did:  A huge gust blew and I struggled to hold it for several seconds at least.  I couldn't pull it closed until the wind relented.  I was glad that earlier I had slid down the glass window a notch to allow some wind to go through the screen, as if in anticipation.  If I hadn't, I imagine something would've had to give and that door would be broken.

Various, mostly smaller branches were fallen on the roads and in my parents' yard.  On my evening walk, I heard a loud crack of some branch or tree coming down, but couldn't see anything.  I saw a few new looking fallen trees while out driving, but none into the road or houses or anything like that.
