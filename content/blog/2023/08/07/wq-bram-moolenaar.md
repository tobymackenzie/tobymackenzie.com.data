:wq Bram Moolenaar
==================

Sad to hear of [Bram Moolenaar's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar) recent death.  RIP.  He was the creator and main developer of [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), the common and influential *NIX text editor.  I encountered the editor in the early aughts from a CS professor who used it and was very quick with it.  I've used it over the years on Linux servers, where it is one of the few command line editors always installed.  It has a learning curve, but I've gotten comfortable with it over the years.  With the death of the Atom editor, I've been moving toward vim as my primary editor.

Bram continued to steer the development of the editor up to its death, so it will be interesting to see where it goes without him.  Some complained he kept the editor from modern features, resulting in a fork called neovim.  We'll see if vim modernizes more without Bram, if the project slows or dies without him, if neovim takes over, or if perhaps some efforts to re-merge the projects are made.
