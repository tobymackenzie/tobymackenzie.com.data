A friend of mine was commenting that *Jaws* got pushback for inciting fear of sharks / swimming with the low odds of getting bit by one, while *The Birds* didn't get pushback in spite of the low odds of getting attacked by a bird.  I opined that it was probably Big Beach instigating the pushback.  I imagine with the tourism money they have a better lobby than Big Bird.
