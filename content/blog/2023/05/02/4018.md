I have finally, effectively, fully said goodbye to Dreamhost after around 14 years.<!--more-->  I transferred my last domain registration from them to Porkbun, which took 6 or 7 days.  I then removed my credit card from their autopay.  I disabled marketing emails in my contact settings.  I still have my account, but no more paid services on it.  I'm not sure if I need to delete it, but I didn't see a way to do so.

It was several weeks since I decided to leave until I fully left.  A [four day outage of my DreamCompute VPS](/blog/2023/04/12/goodbye-dreamhost-hello-digital-ocean/) without any response during that period was the final straw in my decision to move my server, and a near full months extra charge for my attempts to fix the problem pushed me to move my last domain registration away too.  But I had to wait for a client to transfer her DNS to the new server and then for the registration to transfer.

As I've said in my recent posts about them, I liked Dreamhost well when I was on their shared server.  I grew out of that though and don't feel their DreamCompute service is cared for to the level of competitors in that space.
