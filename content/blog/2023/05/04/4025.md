I saw a strange, slow moving string of lights in the sky tonight.  Apparently, a [Starlink satellite launch](https://wwmt.com/news/local/starlink-satellites-west-michigan-sky-space-elon-musk-monday-lights-sky-spacex-earth-orbit).<!--more-->  I guess they spread out slowly after the launch.  They were pretty close and very much in a straight line as I saw them go ever roughly from West to East.  They aren't actually lit up, but reflect the sunlight, looking like bright moving stars.  The sky was very clear and the moon was big and bright, making for optimal viewing conditions, it seems.
