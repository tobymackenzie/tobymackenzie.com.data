When I was young, vacationing at Sandusky Bay, I saw a few big, bright and colorful meteors.  They were red, green, and white, and kind of like a small sideways firework, slower and longer lasting than a normal meteor.  Afterward, I often wondered if I had really seen that or if my mind had just exaggerated.  But tonight, on my drive home, I saw another one.  It was green and white and big, really cool looking.  Hopefully I get to see more.
