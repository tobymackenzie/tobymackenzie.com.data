I was sick last week with a likely cold.<!--more-->  Scratchy throat, cough, runny nose, chest congestion, wooziness, slight fever.  I tested negative for Covid 3 times though.  It wasn't too bad, but I worked from home and not so much for a couple days.  I missed family dinner and didn't walk my normal amount several days.  I seem to have gotten mostly back to normal, just an occasional cough and runny nose.
