Updating to MacOS 14.2 also meant I had to update to the latest VirtualBox version, apparently.<!--more-->  I couldn't start any of my VMs, was getting a "VBoxManage: error: The virtual machine â€¦ has terminated unexpectedly during startup because of signal 9" error.  I had version 7.0.4 but had to update to the latest (7.0.12).  Not sure what the issue was, but upgrading fixed it.
