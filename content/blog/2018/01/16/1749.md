Last week, I had to submit an iOS [cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) app to the app store again.  It's rare for me, and every time I struggle with it.<!--more-->  It seems like something is different each time.  This time I had problems with the provisioning profile.  I couldn't get the command line build with the profile to work.  I did it through XCode and had to uncheck, then recheck a box about automatically signing the profile.

I got it submitted, but have little doubt I will struggle again next time.
