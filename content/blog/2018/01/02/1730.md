Looks like I hit my 5GB data cap already, with maybe 9 days left.<!--more-->  [Thanks Windows](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2017/12/18/1715/).

Things can be painfully slow.  Guess I may have to try making it to coffee shops and the library more often.

Took a quick look at upgrading my cell plan.  T-mobile does have a 10GB plan for $20/month more, still less than half what home internet options run.  Would get unlimited phone minutes too, so I could get rid of worries about running out.  One worry I'd have is if I'd be able to get my current plan back in the future, like if I do decide to get a normal home internet plan.  Don't see it available.
