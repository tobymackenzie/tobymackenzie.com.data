I watched the second episode of [Electric Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dreams_(2017_TV_series)), "[Autofac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofac)".  Right after, I decided to read the book version.<!--more-->  As I suspected, they modernized various aspects, like delivery drones instead of delivery trucks, and computer programming more visible than the mechanical aspect of the machines.  These changes make a lot of sense.

But the differences don't stop there.  The show version diverges so significantly from the original that it is really a different story with elements of the original, sort of like [Blade Runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner) and [Minority Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)), among others.  Like those, not just the story is changed, but also the message.

Even though it is different, the story is compelling and good.  It is still relatively Dickish.  I liked it and the first one well enough, and will keep going with the series.
