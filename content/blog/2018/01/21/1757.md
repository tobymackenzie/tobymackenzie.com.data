Recently discovered the show [Electric Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dreams_(2017_TV_series)), watched the first episode ("Real Life" in Amazon's list).  It's a collection of [Phillip K Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_K_Dick) short stories done one per episode.<!--more-->  As a Dick fan, I'm kind of excited.

I like that movies and shows continue to be made based on his works, but this is especially good since we get 10 together, with the same production and feel, and possibly more if the show continues.

I don't recognize any of the titles, so I shouldn't have the "the book was better" feel.

"Real Life" definitely has the classic Dick trope of questioning what is real.  It includes a world reminiscent of "Blade Runner", with high quality looking production.  It has a more modern feel than Dick's work.  Seems quite promising.
