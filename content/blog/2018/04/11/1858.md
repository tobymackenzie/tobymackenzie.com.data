Finished my local taxes, save for mailing them, including first quarter estimates.<!--more-->  And with days to spare.  Nice to have that off my shoulders.

I did well, though not quite as well as federal and state.  Cleveland switched to a 100% tax credit, so I didn't have to pay more than 2.5% overall for city, instead of 3.25% as in the past.  Nice.

Of course, that was the last year I had to pay Cleveland anyway.  Now I will only have to deal with one city taxes.  Nicer.
