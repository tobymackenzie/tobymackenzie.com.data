I finally bought some bistro chairs for my backyard.<!--more-->  I had been planning on it since I moved, because I liked the ones my roommate had at the previous house.  I already had one of the plastic chairs and some "gravity" chairs, but the former is upright but not that comfortable for relaxing, and the latter are quite comfortable for relaxing but a bit too leaned back for things such as eating, drinking, and tending fires.  The bistro chair is both upright and relatively comfortable, and still relatively lightweight and storable. 

I got ones from Target with teal fabric and folding powder-coated steel frames.  They look nice and I'm pleased with the comfort.  They will be more weather resistant than my thin-metaled gravity chairs, so I should be able to leave them out more of the time.  They should provide many a relaxing sit in the backyard as the weather nicens, and will work nicely for eating at a table on the deck if I buy one of those.
