I once again hit my monthly data limit for my internet.<!--more-->  I somehow managed to go through the final gigabyte in only like four days without any heavy usage I can think of.  Really slow now, but I still feel like it's worth it.

I've been getting better at taking my laptop to work occasionally and my parents every week for heavier use, and occasionally going to Panera, the library, etc. for more general use.
