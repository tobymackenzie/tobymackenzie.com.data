Helped my brother change his oil and install a filter relocater to make it easier to do in the future.<!--more-->  My car (Subaru Impreza) has the filter in a very easy access location, so I wouldn't need something like that, but his Miata you almost have to remove a bracket to get at it.  Kind of neat that they have something like that.

One thing he installed that I might want to get is a replacement for the oil drain plug that is sort of like a spigot.  His next oil change is going to be tool free.

We managed to spill some oil on my garage floor and drive.  I threw some peat moss on there to soak it up and sprayed some degreaser on.  I'll clean it up tomorrow.  Hopefully it doesn't stain too bad, especially the drive.
