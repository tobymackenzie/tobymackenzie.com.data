I did some work on my garden this weekend with the help of my brother.<!--more-->  We worked on the foundation garden on the south side of my house.  We hand tilled in some topsoil, compost, and peat moss with those twisty claw things.  Then we put down a small amount of seed:  wildflower mix, [johny jump-ups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_tricolor) (viola tricolor), and [butterfly weed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepias_tuberosa).
