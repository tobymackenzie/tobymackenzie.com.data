Found everyone in all six levels of the Google April Fools Where's Waldo game.<!--more-->  I had liked that game as a kid.  It took a while, and required some patience and focus, especially the dog tail.

I couldn't figure out the sky puzzle to get to the sixth level, and had to look it up.  Even after, it took me a while to figure out how to make it work.  I hadn't used Google's space map thing before.  It looks kind of neat.
