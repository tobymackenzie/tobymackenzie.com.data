Post 1988
=========

For some reason, I got a bunch of calls from unknown numbers today (yesterday).<!--more-->  I get them occasionally, but rarely more than a few a day.  Today it was at least 11.  That's the number in my chat log, though I know some went straight to voicemail and some I remember but didn't see in the call log.

Only one of the numbers called twice; the rest were a single time.  They were from many different states and even India.

I let them go to voicemail because I've gotten too many spam calls.  The vast majority of these ones left a couple second empty voicemail.  One left a beeping noise and computer generated sounding "Goodbye".  Two sounded like pocket dials, possibly in foreign languages.

Not sure what's up with this, but it's annoying.  Did I somehow end up on some shared spam list?  At least they've stopped for night time.
