Yesterday, I went to the [Cleveland Orchestra Blossom concert](https://www.clevelandorchestra.com/18-blossom--summer/18-blossom-festival---concerts/2018-08-11-rachmaninoff-rhapsody/) with my brother.<!--more-->  They played *Baba Yaga* by Liadov, *Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini* by Rachmaninoff, and Prokofiev's *Symphony #5*.

We traded up our lawn tickets for pavilion sites, and wound up in the first row of real seats (there were several rows of temporary seating in front of us though).  I've never been very close for a Cleveland Orchestra concert.  It was very immersive.  I could see the violin section, conductor, and pianist very well.  I could see the facial expressions and body movements of the conductor that gave a visual representation of the music.  It was cool.  There also felt like more of a connection to the people on stage.
