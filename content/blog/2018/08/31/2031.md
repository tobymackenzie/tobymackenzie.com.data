Kind of a late night working getting a messed up newsletter send back on track.<!--more-->  This was for Akron Art Museum.  The send had over 10k members, and was taking so long just building the list that the people sending it thought it had failed and tried sending a couple more times, getting everything into a messed up state.  I rarely work on our newsletter system, so it took me a while to get things back on track.  Lots of querying and looking through code to figure out what was happening and what needed changed.  I think it's going right now, and will make sure everything worked in the morning.
