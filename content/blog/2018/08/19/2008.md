Went to [yesterday's Cleveland Orchestra concert](http://www.clevelandorchestra.com/18-blossom--summer/18-blossom-festival---concerts/2018-08-18-sibelius/?performanceNumber=16611) with my brother.<!--more-->  They performed Barber's *Essay #2*, Mendelssohn's *Piano Concerto #1*, and Sibelius's *Symphony #2*.  We sat in the pavilion, back in the general admission area.  Noticeable difference from [last week](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2018/08/12/2002/).  Less immersive, but the sound seemed more blended perhaps.
