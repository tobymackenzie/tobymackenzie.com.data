Windows (OS) doesn't seem to be tenable for my cellular data as home internet existence.  At some point, Windows 10 seems to have removed any capability for the user to tell it when to do an update.<!--more-->  I couldn't for the life of me get it to download updates leaving it all day on the network at work.  When tethering at home, though, it happily sucked down hundreds of megabytes before I realized and disconnected.  It didn't push me over the limit, but I will now have to be miserly with my data usage for a week.

Lack of control coupled with seemingly constant, large updates means I can't even really use my Windows tablet on the internet at home.  Whatever happened to update buttons and user configuration?  Not every wi-fi connection has infinite data transfer.
