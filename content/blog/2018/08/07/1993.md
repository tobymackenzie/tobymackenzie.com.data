I guess the WordPress setting "Automatically close comments on articles older than x days" does close pingbacks as well.<!--more-->  I certainly wasn't getting any of the internal ones I sent.  I recently [closed comments on this blog](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2018/07/24/comments-closed/) but wanted to keep pingbacks open.  So, I've changed the `comment_status` in the database to `closed`, set the `ping_status` to open, and unchecked the "Automatically close" box.

To see what ping and comment statuses your posts have, you can run:

``` sql
select comment_status, post_type, count(*) from prefix_posts group by comment_status, post_type;
select ping_status, post_type, count(*) from prefix_posts group by ping_status, post_type;
```

To close comments on everything, you can run:

``` sql
update prefix_posts set comment_status = 'closed' where comment_status = 'open';
```

and to open pingbacks on posts and attachments:

``` sql
update prefix_posts set ping_status = 'open' where post_type IN('attachment', 'post') and ping_status = 'closed';
```
