The `min-content` in CSS grid apparently takes into account the full width of a `<pre>` element content, even if you put `max-width: 100%;` on it.<!--more-->  Because the min of `minmax()` wins, if you use `min-content` as the minimum value of a `grid-template-columns` column, it will go as wide as the `<pre>` content regardless of the max value set.  Also note that the column width value `auto` behaves like `minmax(min-content, max-content)`, and thus suffers the same problem.

In my case, going with a small fixed width, eg `minmax(6em, 50em)` did basically what I wanted.
