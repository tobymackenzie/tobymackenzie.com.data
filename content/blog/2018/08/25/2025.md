A twitter masterpiece: someone called [@CostcoRiceBag](https://mobile.twitter.com/CostcoRiceBag) began each tweet with a word from Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody", in reverse order, through the whole song, taking several months.<!--more-->  It runs from [this August 23rd tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/CostcoRiceBag/status/1032699857117605888) to [this May 7th tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/CostcoRiceBag/status/993553004967100416).  That is dedication.  And it makes for an interesting constraint in composing tweets.
