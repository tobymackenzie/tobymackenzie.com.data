I saw the Cleveland Orchestra's [*Carmina Burana* performance](http://www.clevelandorchestra.com/18-blossom--summer/18-blossom-festival---concerts/2018-08-25-carmina-burana/?performanceNumber=16609) this weekend with my brother.  It was very good.<!--more-->  I really like the work and have now seen it probably four times live.  I have it on CD and listen to it sometimes.  Live, it was very powerful, and made me tingle at points.  It was a little long for a single sitting, but well worth it.

The orchestra opened with *Statements* by Copland, a short six movement piece that had inklings of some of his other works.

My brother forgot his ticket, so I had to give him the extra I had for next week at the gate.

The show was the busiest I've been to this year.  My brother ended up in the grass lots.  I waited to leave until there weren't many cars left, but there was still a rather long line at Steels Corner and Akron Peninsula.  I can only imagine next week will be even fuller.
