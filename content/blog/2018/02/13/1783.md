I think the most important benefit of meetups for me personally is the social skills practice.<!--more-->  At [a meetup this past evening](https://www.meetup.com/AkronCodeClub/events/246623322/), we paired to do a [bowling kata](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/start-points-exercises/blob/master/Bowling_Game/instructions).  My partner was just starting out, which forced me to talk more to explain things.  Her inexperience seemed to make it easier to connect.  I stumbled and probably didn't teach well, but it was good for me.

At the end, I presented what we had done.  I was very anxious standing up and talking in front of the perhaps 15 others there.  Due to a lack of a video adapter, I couldn't show my code, so had to describe it in more detail.  I stumbled and probably didn't explain things well.  But it was good for me.

There was a certain good feeling I had afterward, even before the anxiety wore off.  Usually I say very little at these things.  I'm going to have to try to push myself to focus on this important benefit, my social abilities.
