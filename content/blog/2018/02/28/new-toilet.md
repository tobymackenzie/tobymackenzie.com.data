New toilet
==========

I replaced the toilet in my main bathroom this weekend with the help of my dad.<!--more-->  The new one's a Sterling Windham.  The old toilet worked just fine, but:

- **water**: The old toilet was old enough to not have a gallons per flush amount indicated on it, and the big tank and amount in the bowl looked like a lot.  The new toilet is 1.28gpf, though one sticker says 1.28-1.6gpf.
- **door movement**: The door hit the tank of the old toilet.  The Windham is only 15" wide, so no hitting anymore.  Of course, this only gained a few inches of movement because of the storage unit above the toilet, but it does make it feel a bit more spacious.

I am going to look into selling the old toilet.  I've heard some people want the old high volume ones because they aren't made anymore.
