Welp, my ear is clogged again, has been for almost a week.<!--more-->  This a year and a half after it [happened before](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2016/08/28/ear-jam/).  This is my left ear.  Not sure which it was last time.

It's a bit variable in intensity.  Sometimes it seems like it's going away and I can mostly hear, but then it makes its way back.  There's a discomfort occasionally bordering on mild pain, possibly from touching it.

As before, it can be a bit disorienting and tough to hear people and things.  I will probably start up the [techniques that unjammed it last time](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2016/09/03/ear-unjam/) soon if it doesn't clear up on its own.
