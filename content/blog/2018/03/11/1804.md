Saw two little foxes in the woods right behind my house.<!--more-->  One got within 15 feet before it saw me and they ran off.  Nice to have such nature right there.

I got some pictures with my phone, but they are pretty small.  Too bad I didn't have my good camera with me, though it would've had to be out and ready anyway or they would've seen me.
