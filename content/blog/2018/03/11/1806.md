I went on a rather muddy hike today.<!--more-->  There were some long parts where each step on the trail there was a little slide on landing, my heel stuck on lift off, and then I could feel the weight of the large blob of muck on my boot as it swung.  It was thick, clayey mud.  I had to carefully plot my course to find the best path.  Progress could be slow.  There were leaves on the ground off trail, but it was steep for the worse parts.

Otherwise, it was a good day for a hike, sunny and relatively warm.  I was on the dogwood trail, not far from my house.

One weird incident: Some guy approaching stepped off the side of the trail.  He said it was muddy ahead.  Knowing the mud I had already gone through and that this way was much shorter back to my car than any other way, I said "Okay" and continued on.  He then said "Look, I don't give a fuck what you do, as long as you don't come near me.  Just don't fuckin' piss me off."  Don't know what that was about, but I just walked on.
