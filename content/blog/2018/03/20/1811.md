Started my taxes tonight, going through a free-file website until I got fatigued.<!--more-->  I almost always am doing them right up against the deadline, so this is rather early for me.  I'll still likely take a while on it as a try to make sure it's as right as I can get it, but it will be nice to not have the stress of a looming deadline and to get it out of the way.  The early worm gets the worm.
