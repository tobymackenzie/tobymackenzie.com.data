GiveCamp fast approaches again.  It's a mere 15 hours away.<!--more-->  I'm basically prepared and packed, everything I should need for working and city camping over a 48ish hour period.

I'm a little nervous, as usual.  I'm also not going to get enough sleep tonight, so I'll be tired, as usual.  But I'll manage, as usual.
