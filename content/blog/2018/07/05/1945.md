After using one unit of water for three months in a row, I finally used two.<!--more-->  Since they charge in integer values, that may mean that I'm using 1.25 units per month.  Or perhaps the plant watering I've been doing for my new garden plants has upped my usage.  If it continues to average out to 1.25, I will be fairly happy.
