I went to the Indians game tonight, and watched them win against the Yankees.<!--more-->  It was a close game at the end.  It was satisfying to see them win, especially with all the Yankees fans that were there.

I went with my dad again.

There were fireworks afterwards.  They were good.  They always fill the stadium with smoke though.
