I went bowling again with Jamie and Tiffany.  My promising scores from last time didn't show this time.<!--more-->  I got 103 the first game and it went downhill from there.  87 was my score for the second game and 85 for the third.  We only played three this time.  I was definitely third place in the second two games, but might've managed second place in the first.  Jamie got 140 the last game.
