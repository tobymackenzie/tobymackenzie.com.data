Saturday was my first [Blossom Cleveland Orchestra concert](http://www.clevelandorchestra.com/18-blossom--summer/18-blossom-festival---concerts/2018-07-28-brahms/?performanceNumber=16603) of the year.<!--more-->  I went with the family.  We had subs for dinner out at a picnic table before heading in.  The orchestra played Mozart's Jupiter and Brahms' Fourth Symphony.  It was a nice relaxing evening.
