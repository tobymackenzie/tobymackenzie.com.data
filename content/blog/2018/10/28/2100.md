I went to see *\[A Streetcar Named Desire\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Streetcar\_Named\_Desire)*, presented by [Rubber City Theatre](http://rubbercitytheatre.com/) this evening.<!--more-->  It was intense, cool, and a very good performance.  The actors really portrayed their characters' emotions strongly.  There was humor, shouting, crying, and violence.

I had never seen *Streetcar* before, but had seen references to it in, among other places, the ["A Streetcar Named Marge" episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Marge) of the Simpsons and ["The Pen" episode](http://seinfeld.wikia.com/wiki/The_Pen) of Seinfeld.  Those had piqued my interest in seeing it.

The theatre the performance was in was small and intimate.  The stage was only maybe a foot above the floor and maybe <del>five</del> <ins>three</ins> from the first row of seats, where I sat.  I had to move my legs a little when actors walked in front of the stage, and they were close enough when at the front of the stage that I almost felt like I could reach out and touch them.  The intimate setting made the play all the more engaging.

I got my ticket for free because I [helped build an app for the theatre at Givecamp](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2018/07/23/givecamp-2018-final-day-and-end/) this summer.  I have more tickets and will hopefully get the chance to see more performances, especially [the one where the app will be used](https://www.rubbercitytheatre.com/shakesqueer.html).

The theatre is 15 minutes from my house, which is nice.
