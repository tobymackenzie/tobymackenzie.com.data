Last night (Sunday), I had a game night with my brother and cousin.<!--more-->  We ordered pizza and salad, and played the Oregon Trail card game and Small World.

We failed twice fairly quickly at Oregon Trail.  We had done much better with five players.  A round for fixing calamities becomes quite short with few players.  There's also less supplies.  I like the game, but it can be frustrating with how frequent calamities and rivers come up.  I guess that's how the computer game was though.

I won Small World pretty comfortably.  I totally misjudged how the others were doing, especially my brother.  It's a fun game, but can easily take a lot of time figuring out the best route to win.
