I think I am going to let my .us domains expire due to the lack of whois privacy.<!--more-->  The .us registry doesn't allow whois privacy, meaning registrants must publicly share their name, email address, street address, and phone number in the whois data attached to the domain.  I'm not really comfortable making my personal phone and street address so easily available to the internet.  It seems like too much of a risk.
