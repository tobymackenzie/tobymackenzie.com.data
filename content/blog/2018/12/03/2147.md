The weather was awesome today.  Mid-60s and sunny in December.<!--more-->  I did some work on my front steps, sat and drank tea on my deck, and went for a hike.

For the front steps, I attempted to use some masonry caulk to fill in some cracked bricks and missing mortar.  It didn't go well though.  The caulk didn't want to stay where I wanted it to and wanted to stick every where else.  I made a mess surrounding the target areas and don't think I filled them that well.  I'll have to see what I can do with it next nice day.

The weather turned very windy, a bit rainy, and chilly in the evening.  It's supposed to get back down to normal winter temperatures tomorrow and stay there.
