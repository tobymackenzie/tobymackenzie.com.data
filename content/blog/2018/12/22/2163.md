Ah, we get a whitish Christmas eve eve eve to start this four day weekend.<!--more-->  There's somewhere between a dusting and an inch out there.  That and some [*A Charlie Brown Christmas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Charlie_Brown_Christmas_(soundtrack)) tunes help make it feel more like Christmas time. 

Doesn't look like we're going to get more snow though, and possibly temperatures warm enough to melt this bit and even some rain.  So probably no white Christmas.
