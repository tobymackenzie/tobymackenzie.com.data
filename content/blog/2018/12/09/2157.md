I updated to WordPress 5, but had to use the [classic editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) plugin.<!--more-->  After updating a local copy of my site, I opened an existing post for editing, and was greeted with the HTML content of the post in a text area.  I use the markdown feature of the [Jetpack plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/), and consider the markdown version of my posts to be the canonical version, even though it's stored in the `post_content_filtered` field.  So I looked all over for a way to switch to markdown mode, and looked for instructions online, to no avail.  The blocks sidebar was empty.  I was considering reverting, but decided to try the classic editor plugin I saw mentioned.  After enabling, everything was back to normal, with my post content in good old markdown again.  Looks and functions exactly like it used to.

For [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) users, the classic editor plugin is just:

```
"wpackagist-plugin/classic-editor": "^1.2"
```

I'm hoping things will eventually fix themselves and I'll be able to switch to the new editor: Not because I want blocks or anything like that, but to get rid of a dependency.  Maybe my theme needs to be updated for blocks or something.  But I'm certainly not switching if my existing posts aren't in markdown automatically.
