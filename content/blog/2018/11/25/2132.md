I went bowling at Stonehedge again after a few months break.<!--more-->  Went with Jamie, Tiffany, and Amy.  I got my best score of this recent restart of bowling.  The first game, I won with 136.  The second game, I tied my brother with 126 for the lead.  I actually got a strike in the 10th frame, which may be the first time.  My brother did even better, getting two.

Bowling is a little weird as a social interaction.  There's the constant leaving and reentering of members to any conversation, so discussions are either fairly short or broken up, and frequently changing.
