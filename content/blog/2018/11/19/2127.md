Went to the [Malted Meeple](https://maltedmeeple.com/) yesterday with a few friends.  We played a game called [Splendor](https://www.spacecowboys.fr/splendor).<!--more-->  Splendor is a resource gathering / simple building game with fairly simple rules and quick play, compared to Settlers of Catan or something like that.  I liked it and may buy it for game nights.

I had been to the Meeple once before, at a previous location.  It's one of those board game caf√© / bar type places.  I had a milkshake.  The place is a little pricey with a $5 a head cover charge.  It does have a pretty large selection of games.  It's kind of easy as a destination to meet up for gaming and it allows trying out new games.
