I've gone over both my data and minutes this month on my cell plan.<!--more-->  Went about $10 over my monthly 100 in talk minutes, which may be the most I've used thus far.  It got me to thinking about switching plans, possibly to another service.  There are plans that seem like better deals, but there are always caveats that reduce their value proposition.  Since [my plan is no longer offered](https://www.businessinsider.com/tmobile-prepaid-plan-how-to-buy-walmart-2017-4), if I switch, I won't be able to go back, so I'm hesitant to switch until I make sure any plan I go for will actually be better (at least reasonably likely).
