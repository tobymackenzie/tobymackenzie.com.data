This past Sunday, I spent much of the day cleaning my house.<!--more-->  I cleaned the toilets.  I vacuumed / mopped the floors in several of the rooms, including moving all the furniture and flipping furniture to vacuum the bottoms.  I don't think I will do it that thorough often, but it's good to make happen every once in a while.
