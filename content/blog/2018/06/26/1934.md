I went bowling for the first time in years.<!--more-->  I don't know how many years, but it's been a while.

I went with my brother and his girlfriend.  We bowled three games.  I got second place twice and third once.  93 and 92 were my first and last scores.  I can't remember the middle one, but I think it was a bit less.  My brother did poorly the first game but then got up around 120 the second two.  Tiffany was right around the 90s.

I started with a 14# ball, but quickly switched to 12# and quickly improved.  The heavier balls can really throw pins around without a lot of speed, but I don't think my wrist can handle them anymore.

My wrist, my ankle, and my back are all more painful than usual.  If I start doing this often, I may need to wear braces or compression wraps or something.  My [day of cleaning](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2018/06/26/1931/) might've been a factor though as well.
