My home air conditioner stopped working today, making it rather hot.<!--more-->  My house interior is up at 84 degrees, and it's not much cooler outside to help bring the temperature down.

The condenser unit is making a buzzing noise like it had when it stopped working last year.  Last year, I cleaned the connections in the fuse box, and it started working again.  They looked pretty clean this time, though it was night when I looked.  Hopefully, with some daylight, it'll be as simple a fix as last year.
