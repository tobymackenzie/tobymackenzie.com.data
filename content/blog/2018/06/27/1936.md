Finished listening to the audio book of [*Farenheit 451*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farenheit_451).<!--more-->  I never read it before.  Like many dystopians, it pointed out perceived problems with our world through a society exaggerating them.  Some of these parts of its world reminded me of the like in [*Brave New World*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World).
