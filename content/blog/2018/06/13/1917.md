Went to a Street Dogs concert.<!--more-->  I had not heard of them before, but my friend Dwight wanted to see the show.  I went with him and a friend of his.

I liked Street Dogs' music and the two bands that opened for them.  It's been a while since I've been to a punk show.

My back struggled a bit with the standing for hours in tight quarters, but it made it through.  I bought some earplugs (Hearos) for the occasion, and my ears appreciated it.  No more tinnitus than usual.
