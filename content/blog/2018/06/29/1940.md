I swallowed a pill whole for the first time in my life.<!--more-->  Or at least I think I did.  My breathing became a little troubled afterward, so there's a chance it went down the wrong hatch.  But it definitely went down *a* hatch.

Previous to today, every time I tried to swallow a pill, I ended up drinking a lot of water and holding the pill in my mouth until it dissolved or I gave up and bit it (non-chewable pills can taste awful by the way).  I got a prescription for a weekly pill to help with a vitamin D deficiency, and every week I would spend 10-20 minutes trying to swallow one.  It wasn't until the 10th try that I got it after several minutes.

We'll see next week if I can do it again or if it was just a fluke.
