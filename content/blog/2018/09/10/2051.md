It was clam bake day today.<!--more-->  My parents have done an annual clam bake at their house for some years now, reviving a family tradition of sorts from my mom's side of the family.

We've struggled in the past to get the food done on time for guests, but a planning session several years ago helped us get things more under control.  We've improved every year, and now are to the point where we got things ready early and had no trouble at all.

We got to meet and talk with family we don't see too often.  It's like a family holiday.
