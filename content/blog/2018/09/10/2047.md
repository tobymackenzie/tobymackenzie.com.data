Woo, browns.  A tie.<!--more-->  Not a win, but not a loss either, after something like 17 straight losses.

I don't normally watch football, but it was on at a family event today.  It seemed a loss until the end, when they suddenly started scoring.  But then, both teams missed several scoring opportunities to win it.

I'm not sure I like the overtime setup of football, a modified sudden death with a time limit.
