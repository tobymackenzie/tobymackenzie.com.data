I recently finished listening to the audio-book of [Mother Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Night) by Kurt Vonnegut.  Great book.<!--more-->  I had previously seen the movie, which was also great, perhaps 15 years before.  The nation of two and the standing not moving in particular resonated with me.
