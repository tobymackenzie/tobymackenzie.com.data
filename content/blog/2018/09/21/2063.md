Game night with my brother, Tiffany, Paul, and Vince.

<!--more-->

Show Paul and Vince my house for the first time.

We played Oregon Trail (the card game).  It was long and challenging, and we didn't make it, though I think we came within four trail cards.  The directions were a bit confusing, but I think we mostly figured it out.  I'd say it was pretty good.

We played Goldeneye (the shooter game).  I did terribly at it.  I've never been good at FPS, and struggled with the controls, moving around, figuring out where I was going and where other people were, and with any success.  I got like four kills the whole night, when we were playing to five kills per game and probably five games.  My brother got frustrated and ducked out after a few games, but he was more successful than me.

I borrowed my brother's 32" TV, much bigger than my 24" one.  I may buy it off him.
