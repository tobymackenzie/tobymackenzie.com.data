Hey, the Browns finally won.<!--more-->  I only caught small bits of the game, but I did watch the end.  I didn't really catch what was working for them, but I saw some interceptions and saw that Mayfield quarterbacked.  Hopefully it's a good sign for the season, along with the tie with the Steelers.
