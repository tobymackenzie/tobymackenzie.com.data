Keyboard troubles
=================

I have a keyboard (the music kind, Casio CTK-671).  I like to play it sometimes.  It has, for a long time now, been difficult to turn on.  Many times, the light and screen will come on, but the screen will be messed up in some way and keys won't produce sound.  I can keep turning it off and on and sometimes it will eventually work, but sometimes not.  It has gotten worse over time, and is now to the point where I can rarely get it going.  After like a week of not being able to get it working, I was considering getting a new one.  Today, I finally got it running.  I'm really considering just leaving it on long term, in spite of the electricity it'll use.
