The Planets + Sō
=================

Saturday evening I went to see [Akron Symphony perform Holst's *The Planets*](https://akronsymphony.org/concerts/the-planets-so.3923) plus some other works, including a piece with Sō Percussion.  I like *The Planets* and was glad to see it performed live, especially, as an [EVN](http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/evn) fan, *Mars*.  The Sō / David Lang piece I found hard to follow and understand the apparent polyrhythms involved.  The other pieces I liked well enough.
