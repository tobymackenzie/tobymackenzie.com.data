10k Apart: closed
=================

The [10k apart contest](http://a-k-apart.com/) closed last Friday.  I got in a [few updates](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/site-10k-gol/commits/master) to [my entry](https://a-k-apart.com/gallery/Conway-s-Game-of-LIfe) the last day.<!--more-->  Just a bit of polish.  I added a [readme](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/site-10k-gol/blob/master/README.md) afterwards with some info on things I did with the project, and now can return to my normal projects.  I do want to get some blog posts up about some things I did with this one though, in more detail than the readme.  I spent a lot of time on it.  It was nice to be able to focus on a personal project so intently and play with some things I had been thinking about trying.

Apparently the contest [got almost 400 entries](https://mobile.twitter.com/AaronGustafson/status/782007913518886913).  Pretty cool.  There were 8 pages or less before the contest closed, but now there's 22.  I had been able to keep up with at least taking a quick look at each of them for a while, but now there are just so many, and I'm fatigued.  May not get my vote in till the last minute.
