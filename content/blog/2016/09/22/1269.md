My [10k Apart entry](http://conway-s-game-of-life-10kapart2016.azurewebsites.net/) is now officially deployed, meaning it made it onto the [gallery list](https://a-k-apart.com/gallery?page=4) (was on page 2, but disappeared again) and I have a URL to request an update.<!--more-->  With the changes I've made recently, I sent a request, but it hasn't updated in several hours.  Maybe they basically redo the whole submission and that's why I'm off of the gallery.

In other good news, it seems that the [gzip compression problem I mentioned](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2016/09/21/10k-apart-deployed/) has fixed itself, and I once again have room to play with even without the weight reductions I've made.  Perhaps some tweaks weren't applied until it was fully deployed.

I've put a lot of my free time into this.  I've kind of let other things slip a bit and have been getting less sleep than usual.  I want to take a break, but I keep finding little tweaks that I can't seem to let wait.  So, I may leave some of my ideas be and relax a bit, if I can help it.
