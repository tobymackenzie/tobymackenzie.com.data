Almost lost some work with git.  I was using `git reset --hard` to rewrite some history, but I forgot that I had some unstaged changes.  Luckily, I had stashed it previously and still had the call in my terminal buffer, so I was able to [get the object ID and apply it](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7844566/1139122) after verifying it was the right one with `git stash -p show $ID`.<!--more-->  Of course, I didn't realize this at first, so I spent some time looking through detached blobs / commits to no avail.  Most of the changes were small and would've been easy to replace, but one had taken me some time and mental capacity.  So the lesson is: Occasionally stash things so there is a record of them.  Er, perhaps it's just: Watch what you're doing with `git reset --hard`.
