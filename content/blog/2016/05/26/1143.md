Dreamhost must've had an outage of some sort this (last) morning.  I noticed a little after 11 that I couldn't upload anything to or log into my (shared) server.  My sites were inaccessible.  I tried the sites of a couple other people I know using Dreamhost (also shared), and they were also inaccessible, so it must've been something somewhat significant.  Strangely, nothing relevant was on [Dreamhost status](http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/).  I [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/macybot/status/735490788625256448) at 11:20 and got a response from [DreamhostCare](https://twitter.com/DreamHostCare) that they were looking into it.  They didn't say anything more, but I noticed things were up and running again around 11:42.  I found later that it [must've been a DDoS on their nameservers](http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2016/05/25/ddos-caused-network-issues/).  Outages have been rare, but certainly annoying when they happen.
