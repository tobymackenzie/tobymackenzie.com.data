Listening to some music, I thought it quite powerful, that it presented some important truth of the world.  Then I thought that some others might not find it as such, but may find some other music powerful that I do not.  "Everybody finds their own truths," I thought, as I had many times before.  Truths in everything:  music, lyrics, statements, tweets, books, posts, articles, shows, scenes, thoughts, choices, situations:  anything.
