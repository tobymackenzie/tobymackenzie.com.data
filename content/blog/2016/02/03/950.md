On my site, I'm using Apache's 'mod_deflate' and 'mod_filter' to compress my compressible responses (mostly text), with a setup based on [h5bp's server config](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/blob/master/src/web_performance/compression.conf).  I got my sites running over HTTPS recently, and today, when looking at my site performance with [webpagetest.org](http://www.webpagetest.org/), I noticed that my content wasn't compressing.  It was still working fine over HTTP.  I noticed in h5bp's comments that `<IfModule mod_filter.c>` could be removed in Apache versions below 2.3.x.  I removed it, and sure enough, compression was working again.  I'm not sure why it's different depending on what protocol I use.  Perhaps Dreamhost has separate versions of Apache running for the two protocols.  Or perhaps it's just something different about the configuration in the virtual hosts.  Regardless, it's working now.  I just hope this doesn't cause problems whenever they move to Apache 2.4.
