Raspberry Pi: playing with BerryBoot, RetroPie, and OpenElec
============================================================

Played with my Raspberry Pi a bit more this weekend.  I bought another micro-SD card and installed [BerryBoot](http://www.berryterminal.com/doku.php/berryboot), a bootloader / OS installer sort of like [Noobs](https://github.com/raspberrypi/noobs), on it.

I installed [RetroPie](http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/), a project that is built on top of Raspbian but with numerous emulators and a special interface that can be operated by a gamepad.  It seems like it would be cool to condense all of my video game systems and even my oldest Mac (an SE) into a tiny box.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do much with it since I have to figure out how to get games onto it.  It doesn't have a web browser or other normal Linux stuff accessible from its special interface.

I also installed [OpenElec](http://openelec.tv/), a media center.  It has a dedicated interface meant to be operated by a remote control, though since I don't have one of those, it operates a bit slowly by mouse.  It has various media applications that can be installed from its interface, basically one for each of any online services.  I installed quite a few and watched some old commercials on [GetTV](http://www.get.tv/).

I'm thinking maybe I'll eventually get a second Raspberry Pi to use as a media / gaming center.  It's easy to dual boot them using BerryBoot.  It would be cooler if I could figure out a way to more easily switch between them, rather than rebooting.  opensource++
