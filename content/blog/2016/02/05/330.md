I bought a [rapberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) with [breadboard kit](http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-starter-ultimate-kit.html).  Going to do some experiments.  I may try it as a NAS, home web server, [video game emulator](http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/), and [media center](http://openelec.tv/).  May get several for long-term use if I like them enough.
