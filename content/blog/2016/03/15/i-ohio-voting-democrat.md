I Ohio voting in democrat primary
=================================

Today, "I Ohio voting".  I got in just about at the last minute.  This time, for the first time ever, I took a party ballot for voting in a primary.  I dislike the two-party system and how limited our choices are with effectively two not-so-dissimilar options.  I think regardless of who is elected, more things that I dislike will come to pass politically than things I like.  I don't really want my name associated with either of the large, powerful parties that control this country.  However, I kinda like what Bernie Sanders brings to the table, as compared to the other options.  He was an independent for a long time, and still has that feel, at least as much so as a candidate can in this political environment.  He's down, but not out, so I figured I'd give him a tiny bit of help with a vote.
