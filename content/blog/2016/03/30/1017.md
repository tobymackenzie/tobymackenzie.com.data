I am going to try to post something once a day for a while, either on this blog or my personal blog, even if it is just a short, tweet-sized post.  I think posting helps me document what I'm working on, techniques, things I find, etc. for my future self to more easily find.  It's surprisingly easy to forget things when I figure them out for one project, then don't use that same thing again for a little while.  My site will eventually have something more advanced for these purposes, but for now simple blog postings will work.

Also, I've noticed a strange SEO / traffic benefit to my site wherein my traffic is much more likely to be on the higher side on the day or day after I post, even though those posts are almost never the ones being visited.  Perhaps  the search-engine algorithms see the site as more "fresh", even though the articles that get the bump aren't fresh at all.

The biggest problem with this is that even a post I intend to be quick often takes an inordinately long time as I look up things and add more to it.  Like this post.  We'll see how well I do with my goal.
