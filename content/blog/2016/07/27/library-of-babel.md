Library of Babel
================

Awesome, there is a digital version of the [Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/).  Everything that you could ever write is in there, with some caveats.  Caveats are that:

- each book is less than or equal to 1,312,000 characters
- it is in the English alphabet
- all characters are lowercased
- all non-alphabet characters removed except the space, period, and comma

Any searches would have to be translated to those specifications.

I found this through [Jeremy Keith's discussion of the anchor / link element](https://adactio.com/articles/10887).

The writings of [Charles Dickens](https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?dickens), [Adactio](https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?adaction_a_borges), and [myself](https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?toby_mackenzie_babel) can be found in there, many times over.
