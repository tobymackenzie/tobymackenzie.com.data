Givecamp 2016 day 1
===================

First day of GiveCamp 2016.  Working on [the Cleveland Garlic Festival](http://clevelandgarlicfestival.org/) website.  Seems like it's going to be another relatively easy one, as I think the last few have been.  We are rebuilding the site to run on WordPress and be responsive, plus other general improvements as we go.  I'm on a team of four plus one organization representative.  Things are going smoothly.
