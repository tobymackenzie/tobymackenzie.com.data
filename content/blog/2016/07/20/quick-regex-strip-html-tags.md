Quick regex to strip html tags
==============================

Recently, I needed to strip some HTML tags from some data.  The goal was to make a field in a database that was a WYSIWYG text area into plain text content that could go inside a link.  I did it using a simple regex of `/<\/?[^>]+>/` to find the tags so I could replace them with an empty string.  In PHP, this looked like:

``` php
$string = preg_replace('/<\/?[^>]+>/', '', $string);
```

This is perhaps a na√Øve implementation, but it served my purposes fine.  Of course, I had totally forgotten about [PHP's built in `strip_tags()` function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php), but on comparing it, it also seems to not do exactly what I want.  For instance, it seems to get rid of the content of `<a>` tags.
