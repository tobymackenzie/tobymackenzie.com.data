Today, I ran over and killed some sort of mammal with my car.  It darted out from the side of the road and went under the side of my car.  I only got a glimpse out of the corner of my eye.  I didn't get a chance to do anything before it went under my tire.  I think it was a possum.  I only remember killing a mammal once before, a raccoon at night when I was in high school.  A sad occurrence.  A side affect of our popular mode of transportation.
