GiveCamp 2016 day 2
===================

Day 2 of GiveCamp is complete.  My team is in quite good shape.  We shed one member early on.  I too left to be re-purposed, but that didn't last long.  I briefly helped one team determine that, after my attempt to help them hack a plugin, it was time to jump ship to another.  They didn't need my further assistance, and the organizers couldn't find another place for me, so I went back to my original team.  Another of our members went home early.  Even at a relaxed pace and searching for things to do, we were able to complete their nice-to-haves and improve some things from their quick-setup state.  Tomorrow should be easy.

The event of the day more present on my mind at the moment is that my tent pole broke.  When I first lay down in it, I saw the pole going at a weird angle.  I got out and pulled the fly partly off to find the pole split and rather sharp.  The tent was standing alright, but, not wanting the pole to poke through the fly, I attempted to fix it.  I spent like an hour between working on and thinking of a field repair.  In the end, nothing really got the broken pieces to stay together when the pole was arched.  Now I lay in a slightly tilted, wonky tent, tired  My tent is a Eureka Midori, and this is the second Eureka I've had the pole break on.  Neither had I used very many times, maybe a handful each.  Disappointing.
