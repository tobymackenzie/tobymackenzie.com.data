Just finished baking desserts for Christmas, including all of the cleanup and prep for transport.  Even though I was tired after baking, I just wanted to be completely done.  I spent most of the day between these desserts (planning, buying food, baking, cleaning, etc.) and final Christmas gift purchasing and preparing.  I made pecan tassies (every year) and a [gingerbread loaf](http://shewearsmanyhats.com/homemade-gingerbread-loaf-recipe/?utm_medium=yummly&utm_source=yummly&utm_campaign=yummly) (first time).  Merry Christmas.
