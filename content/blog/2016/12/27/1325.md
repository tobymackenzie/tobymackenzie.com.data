Yesterday was quite warm for December, reaching around 60.  I took advantage with a nearly three hour hike.<!--more-->  I didn't plan to go for more than maybe 20 minutes, but having the day "off" work, the nice weather, and the lure of going farther on this trail than I have before kept me going.  It was muddy and a bit icy, but I had grabbed my boots on a whim.  It rained lightly for a while, even though the sky was blue when I started, but I had tossed my rain coat in my bag just in case.  I went [from South Mastick to the Rocky River Nature Center](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/South+Mastick+Picnic+Area,+Fairview+Park,+OH/Rocky+River+Nature+Center,+24000+Valley+Pkwy,+North+Olmsted,+OH+44070/@41.4225477,-81.8831229,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x8830ed204309eb13:0x2f33f22f355c22ef!2m2!1d-81.8463422!2d41.4336993!1m5!1m1!1s0x883093469244c535:0x29f43f8fc3443ecd!2m2!1d-81.8840301!2d41.4090534!3e2), part of the [Cleveland MetroParks](http://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/).  It was pleasant and good exercise.
