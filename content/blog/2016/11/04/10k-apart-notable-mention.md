10k Apart: Notable Mention
==========================

Awesome: The [10k Apart](https://a-k-apart.com/) voting is done and [my entry](https://a-k-apart.com/gallery/Conway-s-Game-of-LIfe) ended up as one of 12 "Notable Mentions", the third / lowest level of prize.<!--more-->  I figured I didn't have much chance at the four top level prizes, but when I heard there were around 400 entries, I kinda felt it'd be hard to get even the lowest level.  So I'm pretty happy that my effort was recognized and they approved of some of my ideas and techniques.

I believe I get digital copies of [Adaptive Design](https://www.amazon.com/Adaptive-Web-Design-Experiences-Progressive/dp/0134216148/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1478237982&sr=8-1&keywords=Adaptive+Web+Design) and the [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/products/) Briefs, which will be cool.  They look interesting, and I'll be able to read them on my [Kobo](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-aura-h2o).

Another nice thing about the voting being complete is that there is a much more reasonable number of entries to take a closer look at.  With 400, it's really hard to get a good look at the details of each, but with 16, I can look pretty closely and see what ideas may be useful in my own work.
