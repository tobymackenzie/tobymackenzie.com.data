Stir Trek 2016 talk videos
==========================

I'm glad that [Stir Trek](http://stirtrek.com/) has released [videos of its 2016 talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdflS38aeqXfuCTbM2I2S5Q), since I didn't luck out in getting a ticket this year like I had last year.  At least I will (hopefully) be much less tired watching them than when I drove down to Columbus early morning last year.  Of course, the videos are good to have even for people who went:  These multitrack conferences always seem to have multiple good talks at the same time, including at least one slot with multiple "must see" ones.
