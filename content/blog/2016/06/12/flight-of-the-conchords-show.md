Flight of the Conchords show
============================

Saw [Flight of the Conchords](http://www.flightoftheconchords.co.nz/) do a live [show at Playhouse Square](http://www.playhousesquare.org/events/detail/flight-of-the-conchords) to(last)night.  The show was opened by [Arj Barker](http://www.arjbarker.com/) (Dave from the TV show) who did a stand-up routine.  It was quite funny.  FOTC did about half new material, half old, but the old stuff had new parts interspersed.  Funny stuff.  And not just the songs:  The banter in between was plenty funny itself.  It was a hard hearing at times when the crowd was loud, but I caught most of it.  Glad I decided to go.

Of note, playing at the same time and one theatre over was [Opera Circle's showing of *Il trovatore*](http://operacircle.org/trovatore), which my friend / coworker was involved in.  I had been torn between seeing the two.  I checked less than 24 hours from show time for FOTC tickets but it said they were sold out, so when I left, I had been expecting to see the opera, but intended to ask about FOTC tickets.  When I arrived, tickets were in fact available.  The cheapest available was $55, so I was ready to pass on that and started asking about the opera when the lady said there was a free ticket that somebody had returned and that they couldn't charge for that I could have.  I couldn't turn that and a rare chance to see FOTC live down.  Also, I had arrived late for the opera because the rapid took longer than expected.  I've seen many of Opera Circle's operas since meeting my coworker.  So, sorry Wanda, I'll see the next one.

I took the rapid downtown because I don't like dealing with traffic and parking there and for one person it's hard to compete with the price.  I was a little anxious walking around downtown because of an event that happened last year, but nothing happened this year.  It did, however, take some waiting.
