Woo, the Cleveland curse broken after 52 years.  Such a close game all the way to the end.  Stressful, back and forth.  Worked out that the Cavs were ahead at the end.  A battle.  Something for the Cleveland 52 years in the making.  Don't know if this will change things for the future of the city and area, but it at least changes something of the feeling that being a Clevelander / Northeast Ohioan is.
