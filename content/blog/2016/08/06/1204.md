Going to the farm in Pennsylvania where my grandma grew up for a family reunion this weekend.  Last year, I went for the first time since I was a little kid.  There's generally lots of food, some games played, and a big fire at night.  As per tradition, some of us will be camping.  I am thinking of using my hammock tent since the pole on my regular one-person is still broken.  Probably won't be good cellular reception.
