Ear jam
=======

My ear is clogged.  It has been since last Saturday.  I'm not sure why.  All I can think of is that I was listening to music extra loud on the commute home to help blast away the stress of a traffic jam.  It's a weird sensation, slightly disorienting at times.  I can't hear people or things well on that side.  I can hear internal things very well, like chewing, breathing, myself talking, the clicking of my jaw, movement of my face, and ever-present tinnitus.  I've tried several things so far, and the best I can say is that it might have gotten a little better, but not unblocked.  I've tried q-tips, vinegar, alcohol, oil, carbamide peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, and blasting it with water from a bulb thing.  I will have to try once more with these.  I also saw some little ear brushes that I will buy if the chemical methods fail.  And if that fails, I guess I'll have to go to the doctors.  I hope my hearing isn't damaged, but the clarity with which I hear internal things would suggest otherwise.
