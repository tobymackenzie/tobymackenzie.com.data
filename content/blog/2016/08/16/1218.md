Struggling with [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/):

- had trouble with [geolocation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-geolocation/index.html) on iOS
- wasn't able to get [cordova-icon](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-icon) or [cordova-splash](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-splash) to work, or 'config.xml' icon configuration, so I had to manually put icons in place for now
- struggled getting a coworker's build working

Tomorrow, I get to work on the app submission part for the first time.  Sounds like it will be a challenge itself.  Wishing that PWA's had better support.

*[PWA]: progressive web-apps
