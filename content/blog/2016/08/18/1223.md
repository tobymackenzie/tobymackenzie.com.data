Figuring things out with this phonegap stuff.  I will have to post some of what I've learned when I have more time.  We're just about to the point that we can submit the app and then make the rest of the changes we have left client side.  I've never done the submission process.  It looks a bit confusing with signing things with certificates / keys and using the clients' developer accounts.  Hopefully it won't prove too difficult.  I remember it taking a while for the iOS store at least and know we had some problems with rejections where we had to resubmit several times.  Hopefully we don't run into that now, especially since we're on tight deadlines as is.
