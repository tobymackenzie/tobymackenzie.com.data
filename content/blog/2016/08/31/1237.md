Went on a riverboat cruise down the Cuyahoga.  More industrial and history focused than cruises I've gone on in the past, which were mostly wildlife focused.  Learned plenty of interesting things about the history of the river, bridges, shipping, the steel and other industries there, the fires and pollution, and the park and restoration plans.  We got to see some of the steel operations including an ore bridge in grabbing and dropping stuff for a blast furnace.  The operator saw us and did a demo pick-up and drop right by the river.  It was pretty cool.  Also saw a kind of heron I've never seen before.  We went along almost the entire six miles from the lake to the end of the shipping route.  I was there with my parents, brother, and his girlfriend in celebration of my brother's looming birthday.
