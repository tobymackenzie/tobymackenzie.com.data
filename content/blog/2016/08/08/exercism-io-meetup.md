exercism.io meetup
==================

Went to an [Akron Code Club meetup](https://www.meetup.com/AkronCodeClub/events/230345212/) this evening. Started working through code exercises from [exercism.io](http://exercism.io).  Seems pretty cool.  Uses a simple command line utility to load and submit solutions, then the site has a list of other peoples' submissions where you can view and comment on them.  I have tossed [my progress on GitHub](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/learn-exercism).
