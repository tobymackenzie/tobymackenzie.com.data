Crash Dream
===========

I had quite possibly my first car accident dream.  Hopefully this isn't foreboding.  It was weird though, sort of like a video game in that my "camera" was behind my car, except down low, level with my eyes, so I couldn't see the car ahead very well.  Sometimes it would move closer like it was trying to meet up with my eyes, but then move back.  The car ahead started slowing, so I did too, but then it started slowing faster than I could.  My brakes were also weird, like I couldn't press them down hard enough to make them slow like a real car.  Just as I hit the car ahead, I awoke.  There may have actually been a moment of post-crash reflection, but more of in a paused state just as contact was made:  There was no impact or crumple or force.
