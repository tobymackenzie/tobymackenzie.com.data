[Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?568062) now supports [LetsEncrypt](http://letsencrypt.org/) even with shared hosting.  LetsEncrypt provides free SSL certificates.  I'm going to have to try it out on my domains.  My plan is to make my visitor targeted domains have https as the canonical protocol but still support http for older browsers.
