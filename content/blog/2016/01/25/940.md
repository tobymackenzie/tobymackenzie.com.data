Struggling to figure out why every response from my Symfony application is showing up in the log files as a '200' status.  I thought it was related to [this](http://www.fastcgi.com/docs/faq.html#httpstatus) and [this](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/8086/files), since I'm running under FastCGI on Dreamhost, but attempting to set a `Status` header didn't help.  Setting a regular response header in a plain PHP file does work, in fact.  If I use 'mod_rewrite' to write another URL to load that same plain file, however, the status shows as '200', so it must have something to do with 'mod_rewrite'.  Must get to bed though, so I will have to try another day.
