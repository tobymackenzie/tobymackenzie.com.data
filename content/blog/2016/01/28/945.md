Used [SSL Labs' SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to analyze my site now that I have [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates installed.  [Got an A](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.tobymackenzie.com&s=69.163.225.165).  The only things of note it mentioned were:

- My [HSTS](https://scotthelme.co.uk/hsts-the-missing-link-in-tls/) is too short.  It considers less than 180 too short.  The cert isn't even valid for 180 days (90 for LetsEncrypt).  My HSTS is actually only one day, and I will probably leave it on the short side until I'm sure things are safe.
- It is an [SNI certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication), so it will [not be supported by some old browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=sni).  94%+ is good enough for me when I still support HTTP.
