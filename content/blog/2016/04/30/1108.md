[Jetpack's sitemap plugin](https://jetpack.com/support/sitemaps/) has gotten an update or two since I found it [listing the wrong protocol for my URL's](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2016/04/12/1071/), so I decided to give it another try.  Now the protocol seems to be correct, so I am leaving it enabled and hoping it helps Google to get my URL's indexed as 'https' instead of 'http'.
