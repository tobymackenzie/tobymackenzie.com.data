There must've been a flexbox bug in Firefox 45.  Today, it was brought to my attention that nav was getting cut off on a site.  I added a `flex-shrink: 0` to ensure the logo shrank to accommodate, fixing the problem in Safari, but not Firefox.  Thinking it odd that Firefox was behaving so differently from other browsers, I decided to check for an update, and 46 happened to be available.  After updating, the problem disappeared.  I've ran into browser bugs with flexbox before.
