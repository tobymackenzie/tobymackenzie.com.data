Got moved to a new server in a new datacenter by [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/) this weekend.  Seems to be significantly faster than the old one for first page load, like an order of magnitude.  It's more in line with what I get when testing locally.  I assume the server I was on was just overloaded.  It had often had a load average in the 6's or 7's.  I had been wondering what was wrong and if I should swtich to VPS.  This one's been at less than one.  Hopefully it stays snappy and doesn't get too loaded up over time.
