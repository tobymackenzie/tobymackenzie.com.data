I was using [Jetpack's sitemap plugin](https://jetpack.com/support/sitemaps/) and even submitted it to Google until I noticed that it had the wrong protocol for all of the post URL's.  Now Google has a bunch of 'http' URL's for my posts in its listings, even though they are available over 'https'.  I couldn't figure out how to change the protocol (there is no config or documentation about where that is coming from) so I just disabled the sitemap for now.
