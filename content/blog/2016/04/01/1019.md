Just one day after writing that I would [try to post once a day](https://tobymackenzie.com/blog/2016/03/30/1017/), I missed posting.  Certainly contributing to my difficulties in posting is the amount of time I spend thinking about and composing posts.  Sometimes when I have a topic that I could easily write a short post about, I have a desire to hold off until I can write a more in-depth version.  But really, I'd prefer to write more and get my ideas and experiences out sooner, even if the results are imperfect and more open to criticism.  I can always revisit later.  If I don't write when it's on my mind, there's a chance it just will never get written.  I have tons of blog post ideas or partial drafts written down that are old enough now that I don't remember enough about them anymore to easily write about them.

Also contributing to my difficulties is the never-ending stream of new blog posts and other information other people are creating for me to read.  I tend to get sucked into reading them, ignoring getting my own things done.  A while back, I wrote on my whiteboard "Less reading, more writing".  I haven't been following that advice, but that's part of my goal with this post-per-day idea.  We'll see how I do.
