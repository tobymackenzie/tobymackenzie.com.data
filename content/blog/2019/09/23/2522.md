Friday, I went to the Indians game with my coworker Brandon.<!--more-->  My parents had extra tickets they had traded for from games they couldn't go to earlier in the season.  In fact, my parents were there, but in a different section.

It was Brandon's first Indians game.  We talked a bit of shop and some other things.  The Indians did well enough, winning 5-2.  Close but not too close, with enough going on to keep things interesting.

After the game, we went to sit with my parents to watch the fireworks.  The fireworks were a little more interesting than usual, though the accompanying montage of music and Indians game audio clips that I couldn't hear that well was a little confusing.
