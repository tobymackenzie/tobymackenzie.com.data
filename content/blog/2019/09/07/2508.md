I finally got my online T Mobile account working after switching to a new plan last month.<!--more-->  It took a few weeks, mostly due to my inaction.  When I first tried logging in, it said I had to attach a number to my account.  This was probably because they cancelled my plan and created a new one when I [bought my new phone](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2019/08/19/new-phone-pixel-3a/).  But the re-attachment didn't work, and I got an error message saying to call a number.

The first time I called the number, I had the lady try to keep the same email address.  She did something and said to wait 48 hours to log in again.  I did, and got the same error.  I tried the T Mobile app on my phone, but got a different error message, with no call to action at all.  So I waited and tried occasionally, hoping it would resolve itself.

It didn't resolve itself over weeks, so I called the number again.  The resolution was that they had to delete my old online account (much like with the plan) and then I had to create a new one with a different email address.  The lady waited on the phone while I did this, which took a while, but it worked.

Apparently, my old plan was on a different system or something, which couldn't be switched easily to the new one.  That's why the needed to cancel and create anew the plan, and part of the reason for [my difficulty switching plans](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2019/01/06/t-mobile-plan-change-debacle/) earlier this year.

Once in, I was able to set up my E-911 address, which is apparently required to be able to do wi-fi calling.  Of course, I don't have wi-fi at my house that my phone can connect to, so it won't be too helpful for that purpose.  My old phone didn't have wi-fi calling at all.

I can now see my data usage and pay my bill.  This new plan allows me to see a log of calls and text messages, of which my old plan didn't store any.
