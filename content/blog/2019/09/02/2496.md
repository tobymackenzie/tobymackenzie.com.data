Today I went for a good long walk on the Dogwood and related trails.<!--more-->  There were constantly bugs flying in my face in the foresty areas, though that's common for that trail in the summer.  It was slightly hot for the long pants I was wearing.

There were a fair amount of people on the gravel trail running along Sand Run Parkway, which I walked down to see the area of the road that's been closed off for some weeks.  There was a small section where a backhoe sat and some ground was dug up by the side of the road.  It looked like something was done with two manholes.  I've read that there is a sewer problem related to flooding in the area.

A light drizzle occasionally started and stopped.  It picked up a little as I started back, but didn't get too bad.
