Spent 30-40 minutes this morning shoveling the street, clearing a path in the cul-de-sac for my car to get through to the point in the street with low enough snow for my car to get through.<!--more-->  The roads were covered but plowed once I got off the street.

That's basically the state it was on my way home from work, with the streets a bit less thickly coated.  My street wasn't and still isn't plowed, with a single lane compressed path between walls of snow.  Would be difficult to deal with two cars going the opposite way at the same time.
