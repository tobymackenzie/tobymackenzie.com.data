I saw Doctor Who for the first time this weekend.<!--more-->  [Channel 16.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_Television_Network) seems to air it sometimes.  I jumped right in to the 11th season with [Death to Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_to_the_Daleks).  I saw most of the four episodes, though I missed the beginning and some other bits.

It was only somewhat interesting.  The video and audio quality weren't that great.  The story and acting were okay.  However, the theme song was quite good.  Spooky and synthy.
