The two noteworthy things I did on my birthday were a nice long hike and bowling.<!--more-->

I went on my hike in the afternoon to the [Cascade Valley Metro Park](https://www.summitmetroparks.org/cascade-valley-metro-park.aspx).  As I was leaving, I saw a large hawk land in a tree in my yard.  I saw a similarly large hawk on my hike.  I took the long part of my hike at the Chuckery area.  I also went to the Overlook.  It was serene and mentally relaxing.

I went bowling at Stonehedge with Jamie and Tiffany.  I was bowling better than usual, and won all three games.  I again got my best score of recent times at 137.  The other two games I got 133 and 126.  I seem to be improving and becoming more consistent.
