Mighty windy and wet out today.<!--more-->  On my drive to my cousins, visibility was poor with the rain.  It was blustery.  There was an accident on 303 with several emergency vehicles and a single, hard to see cop directing traffic.

On the way back, the wind had blown plenty of debris on the road.  Plenty of hunks of broken branches were dodged, while the occasional piece was knocked up against the bottom of my car.  A big branch across half the road made me stop and wait for the traffic on the other half to go by.  My car at times struggled to keep course against the wind.

A branch was down in my drive when I got home, but I didn't see any other big looking ones.  It still sounds quite blustery though.  We'll see how it looks in the morning.
