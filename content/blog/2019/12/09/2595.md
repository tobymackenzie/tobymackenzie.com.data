I bought myself a new Raspberry Pi, for use as a [Retro Pie](https://retropie.org.uk/) (video game emulator).<!--more-->  I got the 4B with 4GB RAM, around $100 at Micro Center with accessories.  I have a 2B that I don't really use, but the new one is more powerful and can handle N64 games (though with some glitches).  It looks really nice.

My cousin cloned his OS setup for me onto my SD card.  It took much of the evening, as we ran into problems getting the copy to work.  We did finally get it and played a couple games to verify.

In theory, I will be able to play any of my console games without:

- having to switch cartridges and consoles
- struggling to get NES, and lately other system, games to actually start
- games not saving because of dead batteries
