Looks like I've finally encountered the failing battery in a cartridge video game.<!--more-->  I decided to play "Zelda: Link's Awakening" after many years.  When I started it, I noticed there were no saves, and wondered.  After playing for a couple hours (a good chunk of which was saving for a shovel and digging up most of a forest looking for a mushroom that wasn't there), I decided to save and quit.  After powering off, I figured I'd better check if the save worked.  It did not.  So, I guess I'll have to play via emulator.
