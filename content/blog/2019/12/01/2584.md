For Black Friday, I mostly avoided going out during the day, but at night I went to a couple stores and bought four items:<!--more-->

- A [Clearstream 4Max TV antenna](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/antennas-direct-clearstream-4max-indoor-outdoor-hdtv-antenna-black/5894080.p?skuId=5894080)
- The complete original series of the show Knight Rider on DVD
- Some chip clips
- An Anchor 1 cup liquid measuring cup

All were things I had already been eyeing.  I think the antenna was on sale, but not the other items.

I did spend some time looking at other stuff, but nothing else really piqued my interest enough.

I also gassed up my car.
