Christmas approaches.<!--more-->  It came fast.  I have all my shopping done though, in part due to a diminishing number of people to buy for, and in part due to unexpected circumstances and an appropriate combined gift for my parents from me, my brother, and Tiffany.

I work Monday, then have Christmas and its eve off, then two more days of work, then a weekend.  The following week, I get Wednesday off.  Nice holiday time.  Hopefully I can both enjoy it and get some things done I've been wanting to.
