I hung out with my Texas friend Dwight all weekend.<!--more-->  We also hung out with Scott and Heather for part of it.  We  ate plenty of restaurant food.  We played Splendor, Mario Kart, various Retro Pie games, and You Don't Know Jack games.  I did well at some games, but did poorly in others, particularly many of the You Don't Know Jack ones.

The weather was very warm for December.  I could've gotten some leaf mowing done on Saturday if not for the visit, but there's no real rush on it at this point.  Most of my un-mulched leaves are in a big pile beside the house from work of recent weekends.
