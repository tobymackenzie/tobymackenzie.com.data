The [WebAIM page on screen reader techniques](https://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader/) has some subtly funny, slightly dark humor examples on the importance of commas.<!--more-->  Near the bottom, it says:

> To appreciate the value of punctuation, consider these sentences: 
> - Let’s eat, grandpa!
> - I’d like to thank my parents, the pope, and Mother Teresa.
> - He finds inspiration in cooking, his children, and his cat.
