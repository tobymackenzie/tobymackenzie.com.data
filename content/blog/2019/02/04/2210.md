In the nice weather, I washed my car.  It had been covered in salt road crud.<!--more-->  I went to one of those self wash places with a power washer and foaming brush and did the best I could to get the crud off, including underneath.

While washing, I saw a mouse scurry from underneath my car.  Not sure if that means I had a mouse living in my car somewhere, or if it came from the floor grate.  It ran toward the exit of the bay, paused near the drive looking rather scared, then run back under the car.  Hopefully it found safe harbor from the torrential spray.
