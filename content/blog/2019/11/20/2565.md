My Uncle's gun auction went pretty well I think.<!--more-->  Some items didn't do well and a few didn't sell, but some went up pretty high, so it evened out.  The 266 lots brought in quite a bit of money for the estate.  It's good to finally get something coming in after putting so much work into it.

Joe's nephews bought a few guns between them.  It sounds like they will try them out when we get together on Thanksgiving.

I bid on the katana I was interested in once.  It got up to $700 and I chickened out, but I probably should've gone higher.  I left empty handed.  Oh well: He had some cheaper ones I can try for.
