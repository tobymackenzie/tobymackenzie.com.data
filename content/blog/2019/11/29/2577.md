Happy Thanksgiving.<!--more-->

Dinner was good with family, some of whom I haven't seen in a while.  Some of our members didn't make it though.  Food was delicious and I ate plenty.

I spent the morning baking a batch of my pecan tassies.  I normally only make them at Christmas, but I wanted something easy for Thanksgiving this year.  I've made them enough times that, even though they take a little while to construct, they are pretty straightforward.  I made a single batch, half of what I make for Christmas.  They usually do well at Christmas, but there were two other pecan desserts today, so mine didn't sell that well.  But I will have them for myself and can have them with family and coworkers until they're gone.
