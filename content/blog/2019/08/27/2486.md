This site was down tonight, possibly for a couple hours, seemingly due to another issue with DreamCompute.<!--more-->  [Dreamhost Status](https://www.dreamhoststatus.com/) said, and still says "Connectivity Issues" and "Degraded Performance" for DreamCompute, though my server seems fine now.

I had been able to SSH in to the server, but couldn't load the site or even ping it remotely.  The site did work from a local curl request on the server, suggesting the problem was possibly a Dreamhost network issue.  Rebooting led to nothing being available.  Rebooting through DreamCompute's panel led to an error.  I had to hard shut down and start up through the panel to get SSH again, but the web server and pinging still weren't up.  I left things alone for a while and they were working when I got back.

This outage was much shorter than last time, but still worryingly long with no communication beyond the generic info on the status site.  I hope they can resolve these problems.
