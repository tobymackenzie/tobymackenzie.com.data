Not sure what happened, but the [Jetpack Markdown](https://jetpack.com/support/markdown/) plugin setting got turned off by itself.<!--more-->  I published a post and found it displayed in markdown on the site, rather than HTML.  I hadn't been in the plugin's panel recently.  I had to check the slider checkbox thing twice to get it to actually turn on, then re-save the post.  Weird.
