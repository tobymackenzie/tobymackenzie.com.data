I decided to start up my old cell phone, a [Motorola Droid 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_2).<!--more-->  I was then reminded that at some point the touch on most of the screen stopped working.  I don't remember when or why at this point, but maybe that's why I got a new phone (my current one).

Due to the touch problem, I couldn't unlock the lock screen at all.  Thanks to [a forum post](https://forums.androidcentral.com/motorola-droid/6455-touch-screen-not-responding-droid.html), I discovered that I could just put a magnet on the back to bypass the lock screen.  Then, thanks to the physical keyboard, plus the little bit of the screen that touch worked on, I was able to operate it.  It was a pain though, especially doing certain things, so I probably won't be playing with it too much.

I visited my website with it.  It had the simpler old browser styling, and was missing the SVG icons while still leaving space for them.  I may look into fixing icon problem, but otherwise, it seemed fine.  Browser testing was the main reason I kept the phone, and it can still manage that to some extent, albeit without really being able to test touch.
