I went to see the [Cleveland Orchestra perform at Blossom this evening](https://www.clevelandorchestra.com/19-blossom--summer/19-blossom-festival---concerts/2019-08-17-rach-dances/?performanceNumber=17754), likely my last show of the year.<!--more-->  They performed:

- Ives' "Decoration Day"
- Bernstein's *Jeremiah Symphony*
- Rachmaninoff's *Symphonic Dances*

It made for a nice relaxing evening after a tiring day.  I went with my dad.

There was a normal crowd for a regular classical performance, but it wasn't too bad getting out.  I clapped till the end of the clapping session, headed to the bathroom, then headed toward the exit, and the herd was already comfortably spaced.  It was not long after I reached my car that the line in the parking lot was gone.  The road out was full but moving.  I went left at Steels to Northampton, which is a longer distance, but flows smoothly instead of the jam that's usually at Akron Peninsula.
