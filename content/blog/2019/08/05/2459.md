Saturday, I saw the [Cleveland Orchestra perform at Blossom](https://www.clevelandorchestra.com/19-blossom--summer/19-blossom-festival---concerts/2019-08-03-emperor/?performanceNumber=17751).

My mom and dad, and brother and Tiffany, met me beforehand at the picnic area near the parking lots of Blossom for a meal.  Tiffany prepared some tasty pulled chicken sandwiches, scones, and coleslaw, and the rest of us brought sides and snacks.  It was good.

We sat in general admissions in the pavilion.  The orchestra performed Beethoven's *Piano Concerto #5 "Emperor"* and Zemlinsky's *The Mermaid* (based on the same story as *The Little Mermaid*).  Both pieces were good.

We, besides for Tiffany, had spent the day on a tiring, messy project, and it was nice to relax with a picnic and a show afterward.
