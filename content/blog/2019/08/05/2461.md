I installed Ubuntu on my Windows tablet this weekend.<!--more-->  I've been meaning to do so since I got it years back, but I hadn't gotten around to it, in part since I always seem to have troubles and spend a lot of time on it and end up disappointed.  It took a while to figure out and do everything required, and I still can't get internet working.  That makes it almost worthless for me.  Also, I now have to hold down a button when booting to get to Windows.  If I use Grub, it sends me to some Bitlocker screen.  I have no idea what the code for that is, since I bought the machine refurbished.  So, I've kind of worsened things for now, but hopefully I can figure out solutions.
