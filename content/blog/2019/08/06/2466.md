I had to [re-scan my TV channels](https://www.cleveland.com/arts/2019/07/rescan-day-for-a-number-of-tv-stations-in-northeast-ohio-will-be-aug-2-and-3.html) tonight.<!--more-->  I lost Retro TV (16.1) in the re-scan, but added 5.4 (Court TV).  Lost a channel I want for one I probably don't, but I plan to get a better antenna that hopefully gets 16.1 back, and maybe more.

I believe this was to make space for the LTE band 71 spectrum that T-Mobile bought a couple years back.  Since I have T-Mobile, hopefully that will make for better cell signal.  Though I will have to get a new phone that has that band to get any benefit.
