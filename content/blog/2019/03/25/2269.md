Heard a chorus of peepers while out on a hike today.  Spring has sprung, or at least is springing back.

I took a nice long hike in the Cascade Valley area, along the Chuckery trail.  It was nice weather.  As I got warmed up, I removed my jacket, then my hoodie, then rolled up the sleeves of my thin shirt, and was quite comfortable.
