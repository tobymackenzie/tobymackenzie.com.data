It's snowing today after some fairly solid spring-like weather.<!--more-->  A nice, beautiful, serene snow.  It feels oddly perfect, like that ideal winter day.  Perhaps the nice warm weather on either side of it helps make the cold more palatable.  No snow on the roads because they're still warm.

I went for a nice hike at Nature Realm.  There were very few people and lots of birds.  Plenty of cardinals and robins, a few ducks, even a heron.  And they weren't that skittish around people.  There were a ton of worms on the paved trails, which the robins were enjoying thoroughly.  It was hard to avoid stepping on them while looking at the nice surroundings.  The dirt trails were a little muddy, but not terrible.

I've put up my snow script on this site again temporarily to celebrate the nice snowy day.
