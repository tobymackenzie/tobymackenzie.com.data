I saw *Guys and Dolls* this evening, put on by \[Rubber City Theatre\](https://www.rubbercitytheatre.com/).<!--more--> It was pretty good.  Way less intense than the \[*Streetcar Named Desire* performance I saw](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2018/10/28/2100/).  More fun, more humorous, more musical.

Not only was there lots of singing, but there was live music with about five musicians.  Pretty cool to have for a small theatre play.

I think the theatre was a bit more filled than last time.  I sat fairly tightly between a young girl and her family, and a teenage or college age guy and his friends.

I was a little tired and anxious, which partly limited my appreciation for the play while I was there.
