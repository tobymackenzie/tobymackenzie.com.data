Looks like I'll be going to [Stir Trek](https://stirtrek.com/) again this year.<!--more-->  I managed to get a ticket again without much effort.  When I bought, a couple days after they went on sale, there were 23 left.  I'm glad it seems like they no longer are selling out within hours, because it was hard to get tickets before.
