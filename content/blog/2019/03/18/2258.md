I went out to my car today to find the battery dead.<!--more-->  I kept clicking my key fob, but nothing was happening.  Then, I had remembered turning on the map light the other night to look at something in the glove box.  The fancy auto-dimming dome light has got me desensitized to overhead lights being on when I leave the car.

My mom got me this Halo battery pack device that can jump-start cars a few years back.  I've used it for charging phones, but I believe this was the first time for jump-starting.  I would've thought with such a small device that it would've taken time to charge the battery.  Somehow, I only had to run it for like five seconds before its light turned green, and when I got in the car and turned the key, it started right up.  Pretty nice.

The car has a built in alarm that goes off when using the key in the door if it has been locked with the fob.  I had to use the key to get in while the battery was dead.  The alarm started blaring right after the car started up.  Luckily, I was quick enough that it only honked twice before I hit the fob button to turn it off.
