Saw the Cleveland Orchestra perform at Severance Hall this evening, [*Smetena's Má Vlast*](https://www.clevelandorchestra.com/1819-concerts-pdps/1819-tco-classical-series-concerts/week-21/?performanceNumber=16788).<!--more-->  It was good as usual.  I went with Jamie and Tiffay. 

Performed were:

- *Wide Open Land: Music with Brahms* by Glanert
- *Concerto* for Two Pianos in A-flat minor by Bruch
- *Vyšehrad* by Smetena
- *The Moldau* by Smetena
- *Sárka* by Smetena

I had heard The Moldau performed before, possibly other Smetena pieces.

We sat in the upper dress circle, the first time I've sat there.  We sat at the very front of the side, which is a weird little curved section.  There was an inbuilt table of sorts in front of two of the seats which, along with the railing, obstructed the view some.  But it was still kind of neat, being about even with the front row but high up.

We had some mexican food at a place called [Tacologist](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tacologist+Tacos-Tequila-Margaritas/@41.5055694,-81.6107047,15z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1smexican+near+severance+hall!3m4!1s0x0:0x8e1b2f8f2ed07c33!8m2!3d41.5093165!4d-81.6052893) afterward.
