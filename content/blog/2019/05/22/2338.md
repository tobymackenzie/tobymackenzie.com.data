Apparently at some unknown point in the past, Github changed something about their webhook / service connections, and Packagist added a requirement, when using Github to log in, to take control of the account's webhooks.<!--more-->  So, I guess my packages on Packagist may have been out of date for some period of time.  Fixed now.
