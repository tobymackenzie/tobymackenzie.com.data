Cut my hair this evening to keep cool in this warm weather and keep the hair out of my eyes.<!--more-->  It was getting just to the point where I could've tied it back and gotten a tiny pony tail.

It definitely feels cooler now that it's short, but also feels weird when I reach up to touch it.   And it looks a little weird too.

I cut it myself, as I usually do.  It takes a while and probably ends up much rougher than a professional cut.  I may end up doing a bit of clean up at some point.

I always feel itchy for a while after a haircut, at least one where clippers are used.  I often take a shower afterwards.
