I finally got my new driver's license after over two months of waiting.<!--more-->  Ohio recently went to mailing license's instead of printing and handing them to you while you're at the BMV.  They hand out an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper as an interim license, which must be combined with the old license.  I originally kept it in my car, but after getting asked for it a couple times, I folded it up and put it in my wallet.

The mailing is supposed to only take a few weeks, but something must have gone wrong with the first mailing.  I contacted them and they sent another, which did make it to me.  I'm not sure if this is a common problem with this new system.  Is the first copy out there somewhere?

I paid for this license late.  For some reason, I thought they sent a mailer when the license is about to expire, but apparently not.  I had gotten my previous license less than two years before I had to renew, because I had wanted my new address on it.  In fact, in the past decade, I've probably had like seven licenses, with four moves and three four-year birthdays.  I can see the memory advantage of having renewal be on a birthday, but can't they just adjust the date to the birthday three years plus whatever days later?
