Today, I learned that `display: block` on a `<summary>` element removes the disclosure triangle in Firefox.<!--more-->  I had used `block` in a CSS boilerplate for helping non-HTML5 browsers.  My use of that boilerplate and `<summary>` hadn't happened at the same time until today.  Using `display: list-item` provides the desired result and appears to cross-browser.
