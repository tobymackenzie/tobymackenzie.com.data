I recently re-read *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald.<!--more-->  I had read it in high school and not since.  I had largely forgot it, so it was to some extent like reading it for the first time.  I had a vague recollection of some parts as I read them and even more vague premonition of some of what was coming.  The ending generally fit the mood I was expecting, but the specifics came as a bit of a surprise.

I felt like I got more out of it this time around, particularly the humor.  "Mr. Mumbles".  It's probably partly that I'm older and partly that I was just reading it for school back then.
