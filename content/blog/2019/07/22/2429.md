I am home from another successful GiveCamp.<!--more-->  As always, it was very tiring.  When I got home I relaxed outside for a while, brought my stuff in from the car, made and ate dinner, and fell asleep on the couch for a much needed nap.  Hopefully, that doesn't mean I'll have trouble getting to sleep now.

I will try to post more details about the event later.  There was a bad tent meets storm experience Friday night / early Saturday morning that I must share.
