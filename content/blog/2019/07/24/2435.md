Today at work, I came up with the word "æffect" as a solution to the common confusion of two similar but different words.<!--more-->  "æffect" would mean whichever of ["affect"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/affect) or ["effect"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/effect) seems most appropriate contextually.  If you know which of the two to use, use it; otherwise, just throw "æffect" at it.  There would be ambiguity in some cases, sure, but probably less than the ambiguity caused by the frequent confusion of which to use and resulting misuse leaving some uncertainty about whether the writer meant the one they used.

> The effect affects us all.

or:

> The æffect æffects us all.

You decide.
