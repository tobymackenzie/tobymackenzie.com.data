Yesterday, I went to see the Cleveland Orchestra's *Rhapsody in Blue* performance at Blossom.<!--more-->  It was very good.  They performed:

- "Symphonic Suite" from *On the Waterfront* by Leonard Bernstein
- *Rhapsody in Blue* by Gershwin
- Suite from *The Firebird* by Stravinsky
- *1812 Overture* by Tchaikovsky

All good pieces.  The pianist from *Rhapsody in Blue* also played an encore solo.

Afterwards, there were fireworks.  A tree was blocking my view at first, so I had to slip in front of people to relocate so I could see.

It rained earlier in the day, so the grass was moist, but not too bad.  I brought a towel to put under my chair, and it and a few of my things got moist, but I was comfortable.

There wasn't an overwhelming crowd, so I didn't have to park in the grass lots, was able to find a good spot on the lawn (although it looked pretty packed until I walked down the hill), and the traffic wasn't too bad even though I left shortly after the fireworks.
