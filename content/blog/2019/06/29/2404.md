The forecast said 20% chance of rain this evening, and with rain tomorrow, I figured I'd mow the lawn.<!--more-->  It was hot and sunny out though, and dinner time, so I figured I'd eat first and mow when it cooled down a bit.  I cooked and began eating, but started hearing some rumbling noises that began to sound like thunder.  I looked out the West window, and sure enough, a dark storm was approaching.  It was a nice looking storm, but it left my lawn unmowed and wet.
