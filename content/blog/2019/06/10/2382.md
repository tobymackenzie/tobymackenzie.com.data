I spent $2 on parking to save $1.95 (card) or $0.70 (ACH) on my water bill.<!--more-->  They added fees this month for online payments.  Apparently, the library (Akron main branch) parking garage is $2 for what had to have been less than an hour.  It used to be free after 6.  Oh well, at least I got a library visit out of it.

They closed well before I got out of work, but they luckily have a drop slot.  Hopefully I didn't put it in the wrong slot or something.

I could've just walked the few blocks from work, but it was somewhat rainy and I didn't have a rain jacket.  Next time, perhaps.
