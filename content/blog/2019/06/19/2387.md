I was at work a couple hours later than usual today.<!--more-->  I wanted to get some things done, including a task that came in near the end of the day and took longer than expected.  We were also preparing for the owner to head out to the Southwest on vacation.  I got home late and felt pretty tired, ending up dosing on the couch for a while.
