I'm glad I'm [not the only one](https://mobile.twitter.com/meyerweb/status/1141138947122323457) with the problem of duplicate instances of [Atom (the text editor)](http://atom.io/) opening on me.<!--more-->  For me, it seems to happen when an update is imminent and I'm opening a file from an FTP client.  The second instance almost always crashes and then I have to do a dance of reopening Atom and my FTP client several times until things begin working properly again.  Or I just force the FTP client to use another editor until I have time to deal with it.

Hopefully, they resolve it.  Perhaps the reach of the tweet of an [Eric Meyer](https://mobile.twitter.com/meyerweb) will help the cause.

I've also, though more seldom, had the problem with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  Possibly an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) thing.
