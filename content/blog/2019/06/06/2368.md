I've signed up for [Cleveland GiveCamp](https://clevelandgivecamp.org/) again this year.<!--more-->  I think this'll be my 9th.  It can be stressful and tiring, but the experience is worth it.

There were still plenty of spots open, so sign up if you make websites / apps and are interested and able.

According to the required agreement, I may die or become disabled, so wish me luck.
