I drove through a rather large puddle tonight at decent speed.<!--more-->  I was paying more attention to the oncoming car in the opposite lane.  It was also foggy, though not so bad right there.  It seemed like just another small puddle until I got right up on it.

As I hit, a wall of water hit my windows like I drove into a lake.  The car slowed, lost some traction, and wobbled as it pushed through, but did admirably.

When I got home, I pointed some fans at it to hopefully dry out any bits that don't normally get water on them.  The engine cavity looked dry besides for the plastic skid-pad at the bottom.  My bumper, already loose on the one side, needed pushed back into the clips.
