Finally turned on the house air conditioner.<!--more-->  It has been getting up to 78 or 79 degrees on hot days, but today I finally saw it go up to 80.  Figured it's time.  I turned it on at 78 degrees.

I actually turned it on yesterday, but it was making a buzzing noise and the fan blades weren't spinning, so I turned it back off.  Today, before turning it on, I went out and spun the fan blades, just in case they were locked up.  When I turned on the unit, it spun right up.

Hopefully, running this will help with some worsening air quality issues I've been experiencing in the house lately.
