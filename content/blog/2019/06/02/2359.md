On my way to Cleveland today, I got caught in a nasty storm-front.<!--more-->  There was strong wind and rain and even some hail.  It came on fast and everyone slowed down to around 25mph on the highway.  It lasted a while, and at times the banging on my car was so loud I worried that it would break my windshield or otherwise damage my car.  The water was thick on the roads, but we were going so slow it wasn't much of a problem.  Some cars parked on the side of the road, especially under bridges.  Luckily, it eventually passed and traffic went back to regular highway speeds.
