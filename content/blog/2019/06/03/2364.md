Looks like Akron utilities are now charging a fee for their online bill-pay.<!--more-->  70Â¢ for ACH and $1.95 for credit cards.  The office is apparently only about 10 minutes walk from work, so maybe I'll try paying in person.  If the wait isn't too bad, maybe it'll be worth it.  But their hours mean I'd have to go before work or on lunch.  I'd rather go after and then hang out at the nearby library.
