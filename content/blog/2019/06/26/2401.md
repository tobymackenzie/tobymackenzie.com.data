This weekend, I went to see the final performance of [*Tame* by Rubber City Theatre](https://www.rubbercitytheatre.com/tame.html).<!--more-->  It's a modern adaption of *The Taming of the Shrew* with LGBTQ characters and themes.

I liked it.  There was good humor mixed with strong emotional content.  The characters and dialogue were a bit exaggerated and stereotypical at times to obviate their message, but still managed to have an overall realness to it.

This play made use of [the app I helped build during last year's GiveCamp](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2018/07/23/givecamp-2018-final-day-and-end/).  It basically displayed text messages that were "between characters" (actually from off stage) on audience members' phones.  It also had a feature where audience members could send messages that would only be visible by the person off-stage.  I'm not sure if that was used or not.

It was a little hard to read the app messages and pay attention to the play at the same time, but I started to get used to glancing at them in dead time.  It did add a little more to the story at times.  The app seemed to work nicely and looked polished.  Glad I got to see our hard work being of use.

This was the first performance on Rubber City's new stage at their new location.  I guess I picked the right day to go.  It was still a little rough, as it's still being finished, but looks like it'll be a nice new home for them.
