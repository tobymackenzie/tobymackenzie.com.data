I lost my iPod for several days.  Relieved to have found it.<!--more-->  I was digging all over the house, my car, my desk at work.  Didn't get to listen to some music I had a craving for when I wanted to.

My iPod has served me well as my primary music listening device for over 10 years.  It's an 80GB iPod Classic, with more than enough room to store my music collection and a fairly simple music focused UI.

The temporary loss got me wondering what I'll do when it finally does disappear or die.  Apple only makes iPod Touch's now.  That's full blown iOS.  I could just use my phone, but that doesn't have enough space.  Maybe my next one will.
