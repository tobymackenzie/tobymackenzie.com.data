The nice weather this past weekend got me out on two hikes.<!--more-->

Saturday I went out on the Dogwood Trail not far from my house.  There were more people there have been over the winter on that trail, but still not a lot.  A lot more were down in the Sand Run area.  The trail was a little muddy at spots, but not bad at all compared to recent weeks.

Sunday, I went to the Deep Lock Quarry area and hiked a small loop in the forest and then hiked down to Peninsula on the Towpath.  There were a fair amount of people there, especially considering the incoming rain clouds.  The Towpath had quite a few cyclists.  It started to drizzle a little before Peninsula, but didn't graduate to a light rain until I was fairly close to getting back to my car.  I used the umbrella I brought just for a little bit.
