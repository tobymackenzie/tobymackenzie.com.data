Went to the Indians game today with my dad.<!--more-->  Indians won without too much trouble.  The weather was quite nice.

I like going with my Dad sometimes because he knows a fair amount about the Indians players, trades, how they're doing, and what not.  I don't pay a lot of attention to that, but the game is more interesting with someone sharing that information.

The team's offense seems to be pretty good even with losing some players to trade and injury.  Their starting pitchers seem to be doing well too, but the bullpen does seem a little iffy.
