I bought the first two seasons of Stranger Things for $10, on sale at Target.<!--more-->  I haven't seen the second season, but liked the first one pretty well, especially the music.

I had gone to Target the other day for something else, but noticed the seasons on sale.  The Target I was at though only had the first season.  I didn't want to just buy the first since I had already seen it.  Today, I looked on the store's website to find a location with it.  The closest was Macedonia, a half hour drive, and it only said it may have it.  I took the chance.  I found both seasons, but two was labelled a higher price, and had a different box.  I worried that it would be a different version and cost full price, but it wasn't.

I watched a recap, since it has been a long time since I've seen season one, and will begin two tonight.
