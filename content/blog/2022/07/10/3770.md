In April when I had said I'd [seen every Columbo episode](/content/blog/2022/04/23/3726.md), I was apparently wrong that I'd seen them all all the way through.  I just watched "Candidate for Crime" and realized I had only seen from fairly near the end, presumably coming in at that point when it was on TV.

I had seen from around when Columbo was lying on the couch with the newspaper on his head, which was probably less than 20 minutes from the end.  I didn't even recognize it at all before that point, so it felt like a new episode to me.

When I was going through the episodes sequentially on DVD, I must've assumed it was a different election related one, and skipped it because I had seen it too recently.  I wonder if there are any more like that.
