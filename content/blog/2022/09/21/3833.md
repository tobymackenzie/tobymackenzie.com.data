Seems like Facebook rescinded their choice to have dark mode on Messenger Lite.<!--more-->  I [posted September 3rd](/blog/2022/09/03/3803/) that it had it.  But at some point, it turned off and I don't see it anywhere in the settings anymore.  They also reverted some of the other style changes.  I'm not sure why, but I say:  Boo.  Back to inverting screen colors for that app.
