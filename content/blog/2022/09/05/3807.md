I'm still sick, but I tested negative for Covid a second time.  I most likely just have a strong but quick cold.<!--more-->  I'm already on the mend.  My cough at times has gotten pretty bad though and my nose was running a ton this morning.  I feel sore and I've still felt a little feverish at times, although I temped at 98.3.

I haven't left my house since Friday.  I haven't gone on my normal walks or done my stretches for my back.  If I feel like this or better tomorrow I will likely go back to normal, except I may wear my mask when out.
