I finally failed to get my first Wordle word a couple weeks back.  I had missed one in August just by time because I forgot about it, but still got the word after midnight.  This time I took six guesses and didn't get "PARER".  Apparently, it's another name for a paring knife, but I have never heard it referred to that way.  I don't care as much though since I no longer had a streak going.
