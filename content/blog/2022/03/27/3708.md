I thought we were to the end of winter and done with snow, but no, not quite: Another weekend of cold and a couple inches more of snow.<!--more-->  I heard snow was coming and was hopeful we'd only get a dusting.  Yesterday, there was quite a bit falling, but it didn't really stick.  But overnight, it did.  The roads are clear though and no shoveling is necessary, and the temperature isn't too bad, so it's actually somewhat pleasant.  And warmth is coming.
