I have now seen every Columbo episode, both the regular series and TV movies.<!--more-->  I had probably seen them all several weeks ago or earlier, but may have missed some beginnings because some of them I caught partway through on TV.  I now have watched them on the [DVD box set](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B64Z7HQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) all the way through.

I got the box set on Black Friday 2020 and have been watching off and on since.  At first I was watching them myself, and watched through the regular series and some of the movies.  My health issues came in 2021 and I started spending more time with my parents.  At some point, my dad started joining me, so we've been watching one episode a week since.  We've switched back and forth between the next movie episode and a regular series episode that I had already seen but liked, later going through [Columophile's favorites list](https://columbophile.com/episode-rankings/).  We still have about 2/3 of that list to go for my dad to see them all.
