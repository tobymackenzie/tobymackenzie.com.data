I lost my first [Quordle](https://quordle.com) yesterday, after winning 17 straight.<!--more-->  Quordle is a game similar to [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), but with four word boards at once to up the challenge.  In exchange, 9 attempts are allowed instead of 6.  Yesterday, I went a little too fast on the early words and ended up with only one chance to get the fourth and final word with only three letters, "HOL", none in their place.  It took me quite a while to come up with a word that would even work, "GHOUL".  The actual word was "HOLLY".

I have still not lost at world, where I have a winning streak of 67.
