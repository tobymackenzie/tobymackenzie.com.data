An episode of Pawn Stars pushed me to pull out my old Nintendo Power magazines from my parents' basement.<!--more-->  Luckily, I kept them in bags, so they stored pretty good.  The bags had some gunk and dust that had fallen on them, but it didn't get to the magazines.  I have issue 14 (two copies), then 23 to around 100, though there may be gaps.  The older ones aren't in that great shape.  The newer ones look pretty nice.

Now, they are in bags in my basement.  Maybe I'll take a look through some of them when I get a chance.
