I have hit 100 consecutive wins in Wordle, winning every game I've played.<!--more-->  I've won:

- 6 in 2 guesses
- 26 in 3 guesses
- 40 in 4 guesses
- 18 in 5 guesses
- 10 in 6 guesses

I'm pretty comfortable with the game, unlike with Quordle, in which I've lost 6 of 52.  My starting words are usually "THOSE" or "CLEAR" for their common vowels and consonants.
