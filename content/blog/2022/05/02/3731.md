I got bit by a tick again.  Seems to be an annual occurrence now after not having any for most of my life.<!--more-->  This was larger than the first tick I got bit by a couple years back.  It really held on as I pulled if off with tweezers.  I hadn't felt it until that point, when it hurt somewhat.  I squeezed it hard with the tweezers but they didn't kill it.  I put it in a pill container and into the freezer.

The tick barely left a mark.  I cleaned the bite and used Neosporin, and will watch it over the next several days.  I don't think it was a deer tick.  It was fairly brown and rumpled.  So, hopefully not a problem.  Of course, now I'm checking every little itch or movement of hair to see if it's a tick.
