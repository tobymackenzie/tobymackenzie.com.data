I got bit by another tick, this one in my hair.  I scratched my head and felt it, then scratched it off and grabbed it.  I guess it's time for my summer haircut.

I flushed it down the toilet.  Normally, I don't kill anything, but ticks and mosquitos that have bitten me, I make an exception for.  They are essentially attacking me, and can transmit diseases.

I don't think it was a deer tick, which is the Lyme disease one, but it's hard to tell what it was for sure from the pictures I see online.  It seemed mostly gray-brown.
