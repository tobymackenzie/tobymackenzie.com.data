More snow.  More shoveling.<!--more-->  Late Wednesday, Thursday, and daytime Friday, it was pretty continuous snow.  I shoveled a few times each day starting Thursday morning, and it just kept piling up more.  I'm not sure how much fell, but it was over 9 inches.  Lots of exercise.  The sides of the drive and other areas have gotten piled up high, and throwing snow over them took a lot of extra work.  The snow was very heavy.  I'm a little bit sore, but I went with lots of small loads over fewer heavy loads, lifted without bending, and paused when needed.  I've gotten pretty good at shoveling without hurting my back too much.
