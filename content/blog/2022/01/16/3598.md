It's the first significant snow of the winter, already mid-January.<!--more-->  There's perhaps a few inches so far, but the bulk is supposed to fall overnight.  The roads were plowed at some point, but there's a solid coverage of snow on them.  I had to drive pretty slow going down the steeper hills.  My all wheel drive Impreza made it up them alright, though there was some brief spinning and sliding from time to time.  There was less traffic than usual, but still I had to pass numerous cars.  The usual slow passing to ensure we both could fit without sliding off the road.  For some reason my tire pressure warning came on:  I'll have to check it tomorrow.

We'll see tomorrow what kind of shoveling I have to do.  Luckily, I won't have to go out until evening.
