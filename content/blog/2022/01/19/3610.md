I did another shoveling session this morning, in place of my normal morning walk.<!--more-->  It makes for a good workout.  At my parents', I shoveled the walkway to the front door, expanded the driveway apron and access to the mailbox, and did a bit more cleanup on other areas of the drive.  That is probably good enough to work for the moment.  The snow also melted down some during the day, which helped.
