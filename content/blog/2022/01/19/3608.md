I did a bit more shoveling today, helping my dad shovel their drive.<!--more-->  My mom had gotten out with her SUV and partial shoveling.  When I arrived, I thought I might be able to pull in, but got stuck at the end of the drive.  The tail end was sticking into the street while I did part of the shoveling.  Luckily, their street doesn't get much traffic and no one came by.  Their drive is longer than mine.  It is gravel, so we can't shovel all the way down.  We left an inch or two of snow and just did enough of the drive for both of their cars to be able to get out.

Tomorrow, perhaps, we'll get their walkways.
