Happy new year.<!--more-->  It was a tough, unusual year for me with health problems, but I think I've made things better overall for myself.  I certainly feel way better than I had.  I hope this new year I can continue with that.  And I hope this new year brings this covid pandemic to a more manageable state and things go well for everyone in general.  After going through my health problems, I feel somewhat content in where I am, and I hope that everyone can feel that, and no one has to feel anxious and fearful and hopeless beyond their capabilities.
