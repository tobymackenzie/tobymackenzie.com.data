I don't think I've seen a TV station fast forward random parts of it's shows before, but Quest (channel 3.4) did it Friday night during *Ice Road Truckers*<!--more-->  They started it near the end of one episode and then did it throughout the next.  At first it seemed to mostly be between the talking, so it wasn't too bad, but then it started speeding through bits and sections of conversations.  Made it difficult and annoying to watch.  I wonder if they didn't show their ad quota earlier and had to get it in by the end of the night.
