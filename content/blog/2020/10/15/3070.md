As of the start of Prime day yesterday, the Amazon home page seems to completely freeze up my laptop.<!--more-->  It may leave me with mouse movement but nothing else, freeze everything entirely, or just restart itself right away, but it always requires a forced restart.  I'm not sure if it's the age of my Macbook (nearing 11 years), failure to test in Firefox, or what.  It may have something to do with a video at the top of the page, because the first couple of times I loaded it, a video would start to play, but looked like a scrambled blocky rainbow, before everything finally froze.  Now it's instant.  More impetus to finally upgrade I suppose.
