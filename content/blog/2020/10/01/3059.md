I watched the NBA finals game tonight, the one series they have all games on broadcast TV.<!--more-->  Very few playoff games were broadcast, at least at times I was checking.  The Lakers handily won this game.  They're who I want to win, but I hoped for a closer game and with less injuries.  I hope and suspect that Miami will be able to adjust and pull things together and bring it closer next time, unless injuries overcome them.  Anyway, there was still some good basketball in the game, and I hope for an entertaining series, since I can actually watch it.
