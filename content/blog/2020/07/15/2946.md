I was confused why an instance of [`aria-labelledby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-labelledby_attribute) was not working properly in some accessibility tests of a navigation button I made for Cogneato, until I noticed that the attribute is supposed to have two "l"s.<!--more-->  I had only one.  A difference between British and American English I believe.  I'll have to remember that.
