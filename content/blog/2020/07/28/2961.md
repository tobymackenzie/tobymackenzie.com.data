I had a sit down meal at a restaurant for the first time since restaurants were locked down around [March 15th](/content/blog/2020/03/16/2712.md).  I had Mexican with a co-worker.<!--more-->  Also probably the first Mexican I had since lockdown, though I've made some Mexican inspired dishes.

It was unplanned, but he floated the idea just as lunch time came.  We went to the place on Exchange, the one he knew was open.  I got a taco salad.  It was good enough.

It was good to see my co-worker in person after only communicating textually for months.  We talked as we ate about what has happened since we'd seen each other last.  Good to catch up.
