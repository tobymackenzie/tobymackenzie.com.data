Watching a streaming movie on Amazon video today, I was disappointed to find it had taken 800-900 MB.<!--more-->  Opening  the settings, I noticed it somehow had gotten switched to "Best" quality.  It didn't use as much as "Best" should, but still more than it should've for the "Good" that I want it on.  Normally a movie of that length would take maybe 500 MB.  It did look pretty high quality thinking back, but I will probably regret it when I hit my 10 GB.
