Had a nice 4th of July dinner at my parents today (the 5th of July).<!--more-->  Ribs, pulled pork, beans, and cucumber salad were all delicious, followed by water melon and cupcakes for dessert.  We ate dinner inside and then went outside for dessert after it had cooled some.  We each fired their toy cannon as our "fireworks" for the day.  It was good to catch up with family and to recover from my weekend working on my car.
