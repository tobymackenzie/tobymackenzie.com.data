I watched [*Nineteen Eighty-Four* (the film)\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen\_Eighty-Four\_(1984\_film)) for the first time tonight.<!--more--> It was decent.  It has been at least 20 years since I read \[the book\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen\_Eighty-Four), so my memory is a bit foggy of it, but the film seemed different on some important points from what I remember of the book.  It certainly lacked the depth that the book could go into on things such as the language, history, and politics.  I remember liking the book and will have to read it again soon.  Anyway, the film still carried some important points from the book.  As with many dystopian stories, it exaggerates certain negative characteristics of reality in a fictional, other world to make points about them in ours.  Reality is, to some degree, a much subtler *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, just as it is a \[*Brave New World*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World), &c., sociopolitically, &c.
