I watched some of the online bidding for [the art auction](https://racheldavisfinearts.com/auctions/1-2H0T7G/fine-art-sale-221) that had some items from my Uncle Joe's estate today.<!--more-->  I even bid on [one item](https://racheldavisfinearts.com/lots/view/1-2QT1K1/franklin-moody-oil) because I kinda liked it and didn't want it going for too cheap.  It went up to exactly my bid, but due to the order of the bids, the other person got it.  I considered raising my bid, but it closed within a few seconds of saying "fair warning".  Anyway, it likely would've sold for 33% less if I hadn't bid.

I think the auction went fairly well, considering the in person part was cancelled.  I tallied up a little over $12k for pieces from the estate, which was a little over the average of the appraised estimate ranges for the pieces, and that's with one piece being passed.

I will most likely just buy the cheaper pieces at the estate sales.
