I've suddenly lost ability to connect to LTE on T-Mobile.<!--more-->  It is switching between H+ and 3G.  Hopefully it's that they're installing some new antennas or something for more bandwidth and not that they're running into problems with handling traffic.  It is 1 AM though, a little late for a traffic spike I would think.
