My regular T-Mobile service came back after like 15 minutes.<!--more-->  I had to help it along though by turning the data off and then on again when it stopped working completely a couple times.  Not a long outage, but it did come when I was trying to get something done real quick before bed.  Now I'm up a little later than I wanted.
