As if Amazon was celebrating my recent purchase of the domain <macn.me>, which reminded me of [Mac and Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_and_Me), they added the movie to Amazon Prime this month.<!--more-->  I know it wasn't on there last month because I searched right around when I bought the domain and it wasn't there.  Perhaps my search showed up in their statistics and sparked a childhood memory of some Amazon employee, who then worked out the deal to get it on Prime.

To celebrate, I watched the movie for the first time since I was a kid.  It was strange, and not that good.  But definitely a reminder of the 80s.
