The [first of my Uncle Joe's estate sales](https://www.estatesales.net/OH/Berea/44017/2488977) is happening this weekend.<!--more-->  It started today and will run through Sunday afternoon.  I'm going to try to make it there tomorrow.  There is a ton of stuff.  There has to be thousands of items.  I haven't been there yet, but I've seen the pictures.  It's all staged really nicely, considering the mess that it came from.

It's not actually at Joe's house, because there is still so much stuff there, and this sale is partly to make room to have later sales there.  It's at the auction house where Joe's guns were sold.  Hopefully it goes as well as the auctions did.  I don't know what the prices are yet, but just the sheer quantity would suggest a lot of money for everything.
