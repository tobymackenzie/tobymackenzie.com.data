The [second estate sale of my Uncle's stuff](https://www.estatesales.net/OH/Berea/44017/2509080) will be happening in a week, assuming it doesn't get cancelled due to this virus lockdown.<!--more-->  Lots more stuff.  I will try to make it again, and may purchase a painting or an elephant sculpture (my Uncle liked elephants) or something else.

The last sale supposedly brought in something like $20k (though not all goes to the estate).  That's pretty significant since it's just a small portion of the stuff.  If this next one and future ones bring in that much each, that will make for a hefty amount added to the estate.
