Short domain intro card
=======================

To make use of the short domain I bought recently ([macn.me](//macn.me)), I came up with the concept of a business card-like intro landing page.<!--more-->  All subpaths, eg macn.me/about would continue redirecting to my main site.  The landing page'd sort of be something I could give out to people easily for a quick synopsis of my contact information, like handing out a business card but on the web.

I had some fun in designing it with the constraints of the concept and seeing what I could do with some of the ideas I had for a printed business card ported to a simple implementation on the web.  I spent more time than perhaps I should've tweaking and trying different things.

I played with some CSS I don't often use, like [`mix-blend-mode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode), and a failed attempt to use [`mask-image`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-image) with [`radial-gradiant`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/radial-gradient).

I made sure to mark up with [Person schema microdata](https://schema.org/Person).
