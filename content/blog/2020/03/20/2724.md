[An art auction](https://racheldavisfinearts.com/auctions/1-2H0T7G/fine-art-sale-221) with some pieces from my Uncle's estate is happening tomorrow.<!--more-->  There seems to be [a separate website for bidding](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/catalog/163284_fine-art-at-auction-sale-221/).

It was originally going to be both a live auction and online, but due to the virus lockdown, it will be held online only.  Hopefully that won't hurt the prices the auction can fetch too much.  There's a chance that people spending more time at home get to thinking about what art could make their place a little nicer.

Only 20 of the 400+ pieces are from my Uncle.  His are lots [18](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82431585_helmut-breuninger-oil), [94](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82431693_barbara-latham-oil), [98](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82431699_eugene-mackaben-oil), [202](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82431857_william-j-eastman-oil), [224](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82431888_fred-leach-tempera), [238](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82431919_daniel-hodermarsky-oil), [262](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82431969_dan-hodermarsky-oil), [325](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432062_george-michaud-oil), [334](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432076_miguel-berrocal-puzzle-scultpure), [335](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432077_miguel-berrocal-puzzle-sculpture), [340](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432084_ahuva-sherman-oil), [344](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432093_luis-toledo-mixed-media), [344A](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432095_buckminster-fuller-aluminum-collapsible-sculpture), [346](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432097_franklin-moody-oil), [348](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432100_loet-vanderveen-metal-sculpture), [349](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432101_joseph-ramsauer-oil), [355](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432110_leonardo-nierman-watercolor), [376](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432141_abe-frajndlich-photograph), [401](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432177_gene-and-rebecca-tobey-bronze), and [402](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432178_gene-and-rebecca-tobey-bronze).  The [Buckinster Fuller sculpture ("Jitterbug Atom")](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432095_buckminster-fuller-aluminum-collapsible-sculpture) is the most valuable by far, already bid at $2100,  Overall, it's not looking like this auction will bring in a lot compared to the other sales.

There aren't many pieces I'm particularly interested in, especially since I'm probably not wanting to spend much more that $100 on a piece.  The [native American painting ("A Turquoise and Silver")](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432097_franklin-moody-oil) is nice.  It's already at $100.  I might be willing to bid on it if it doesn't go up too much.  The two Tobey sculptures ([401](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432177_gene-and-rebecca-tobey-bronze) and [402](https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/82432178_gene-and-rebecca-tobey-bronze)) are somewhat interesting to me in part because of the artists' last name, similar to my first name.  They are also bid around $100 now.
