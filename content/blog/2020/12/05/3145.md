I watched a MacGyver TV movie because I had the theme song in my head, only to find that they didn't even use that theme song in the movie.<!--more-->  I'm not really sure how the theme ended up in my head, because I think it's been a couple years since I last saw the show, revisiting it on Amazon Prime for a couple episodes before it got removed.  Perhaps I caught a bit of an episode on one of the TV channels.  I think it shows during the day when I'm usually not watching.

I bought the movies a while back since I saw them at The Exchange for cheap, but never got around to watching them until today.  One more movie left (there were only two).  Hopefully it has the proper theme.

Of course, I had to pull up the theme on YouTube right after.
