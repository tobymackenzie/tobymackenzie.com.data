I spent some time playing with my Raspberry Pi's this weekend.<!--more-->  I took advantage of my new home internet to downloaded more recent OS's and set up some on micro-SD cards.  I have a Pi 2 that I want to make either a backup server or a file server / NAS-like device.  I installed Raspberry OS Lite (basically the server version) on a card for it, though I didn't get around to setting it up.  I have a Pi 4 that is running Retro Pie (video game emulation), but it was kind of a non-official release.  I installed the official 4.7 release, but didn't get around to setting it up.  I will have to copy all the games and saves from the old version.  I also set up a desktop version of Raspberry OS on the 4 and played with it a little.  I'm considering trying it out for some casual web browsing, some web dev, and other general computing uses.  I'm wondering if it's capable enough to become my primary, or maybe semi-primary computer, the latter being more reasonable if I get a good NAS system setup.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation now has first party [Raspberry Pi Imager software](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) for installing OS's onto cards.  It makes it very easy.  It allows selecting from a list of pre-chosen OS's, then choosing the card, and then press button, and it will wipe the card, auto-download the OS, and install it.  Unfortunately, it seems like it will only save a copy of the most recent downloaded OS and doesn't allow (easily) keeping more for later use, which isn't very data usage friendly.  So I manually [downloaded the OS images from the website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) and then used the bottom OS option of using a custom image.
