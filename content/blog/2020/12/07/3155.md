Yay Browns for a great half of a game that was fun to watch, and for pulling off the win in spite of a pretty bad second half.<!--more-->  The multiple pass trick play I believe from the first quarter was especially fun.  Football would be more exciting if they did those sort of plays more often, but of course they're higher risk and rely somewhat on rarity for success.

It felt like the refs helped the Titans more in the second half than they helped the Browns in the first.  There was one play where it looked like it had to be either an incomplete pass or a Titans fumble that was recovered by the Browns for a touchdown, but it was somehow a completed pass with no fumble.  I could swear the Titans guy was standing when he dropped it, but there was no replay and they just moved on.  I think it's [referenced in this tweet](https://twitter.com/DesignsSmiths/status/1335692266200068097) and [this one](https://twitter.com/mrroader14/status/1335692225683083264).
