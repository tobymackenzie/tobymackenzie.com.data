I figured out why the T-Mobile Home Internet router has SMS in its web interface: I had to retrieve an auth code through it to set up my web account.<!--more-->  Kind of goofy, but they may not have many prepaid users signing up for the service and needing to create a new postpaid account.  Too bad I can't see those SMS from the phone app, or it would've been a little easier to set up.
