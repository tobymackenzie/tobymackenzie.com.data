I bought some stuff from the [5th estate sale of my Uncle Joe's stuff](https://www.estatesales.net/OH/Parma-Heights/44130/2612436) today.<!--more-->  It's happening this weekend, finishing tomorrow with most things discounted 50%.  There was still a lot left when I went today.  Hopefully they do well with it.

I think I bought more at this one than any previous one.  I got:

- a VCR / DVD combo player (Toshiba D-KVR20)
- Roger Rabbit VHS
- Short Circuit 2 VHS
- Japanese bird painting
- one of those kneeling seat things
- 1812 Overture record
- Mahler CD
- Berlioz CD by Cleveland Orchestra
- Rachmaninoff CD
- Two "Dream Melodies" classical CDs
- Pajama Sam 3 computer game
- *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Through the Looking Glass* book

The house is even cleaner than it was last time and has come a long way from when we were working in there.  Getting closer to the end.
