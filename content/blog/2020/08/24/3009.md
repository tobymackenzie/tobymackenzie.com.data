I've just learned that, with the MySQL command line client, one can run `\s` or `status;` and get a nice readout of status information.<!--more-->  Among other things, it gives a nice human readable uptime status, the search for which led me to [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40244701/1139122) providing that as a solution.  Neither seem to work through other types of connections, such as what we get with a programming language, which limits its usefulness, but it's nice for server administration.  If I came across this in the past, I certainly don't remember it.
