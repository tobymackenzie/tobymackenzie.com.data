This was the first memorial day in I don't know how many years that I didn't go to the Peninsula memorial day parade.  It was cancelled due to the coronavirus.<!--more-->  I started going in high school, as part of the marching band that performs there.  I probably missed some years while I was in college, but started going with my dad, and it became somewhat of a tradition, which came to include a cookout with burgers afterward.  Anyway, it will presumably be back next year.

Instead of the usual plans, I stayed home.  I "clocked in" for work for like 20 minutes to check on things and fixed a small issue.  I spent a little time outside on the nice, hot day.  But most of the day was spent on a plumbing project.  My kitchen sink is out of commission, has been since Saturday.  The issue originally was stopped drain flow, but I broke a pipe and now have a larger project.
