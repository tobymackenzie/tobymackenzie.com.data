I saw my family for the first time in over a month this past weekend.  'Twas also the first social, in person visit with anyone in that period.<!--more-->  Friday marked an easing of the Ohio lockdown, a move from a stay-at-home order to a stay-safe order.  We met out on my parents' deck and kept our distance.  It was really nice weather and there were lots of birds about.  We talked for a little while, but it went quick really.  It was good to see everyone again.  Hopefully we can do something like that again soon.
