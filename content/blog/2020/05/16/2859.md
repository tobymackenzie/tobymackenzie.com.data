I'm glad the temperatures have warmed back up and we have spring-like weather again.<!--more-->  So nice to be able to comfortably go outside and sit on my deck or stand on my overlook or go for a hike.  I've been able to open the windows the last couple days and let the nice breeze in.

Yesterday, while I was out in the woods, there were a bunch of hawks and possibly some buzzards flying around, zooming at times, and sometimes landing in trees.  There probably were at least 10, with as many as 5, maybe more, in my field of vision at once.  I know some were hawks, the lighter colored ones, but there were also some darker colored ones.
