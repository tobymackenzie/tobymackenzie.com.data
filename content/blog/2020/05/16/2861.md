The [second estate sale](https://www.estatesales.net/OH/Berea/44017/2509080) of my Uncle's stuff, delayed because of coronavirus, is finally happening this weekend.<!--more-->  I may try to go, though we don't have any family plans to meet this time.  I'm not sure if there's anything I particularly want and it's a long drive.  The whole distancing / mask thing will complicate the situation as well.  But there's a chance some of the art or something else I'm interested in is there and just not pictured.  And, it just would be good to see the stuff we spent so much time preparing finally going to sale in person.  So much stuff.  So, maybe.
