I did it.  I filed my taxes.<!--more-->  Federal and state, at least.  I was not planning on going all the way through it tonight.  Every year there is a curve ball.  I had started a couple weeks ago or something, but ran into a problem with a 1099-R, the first year I've had one of those.  Frustrating trying to figure it out.  I used TurboTax, which is abstracted quite a bit from the underlying forms. I actually switched to doing the PDF forms myself, but ran into problems there too, so I switched back.  I hope that I did it right, as always.  I made a decision of how to deal with that tonight and just got rolling and kept on going.

I was considering finally getting professional help this year, but there's the coronavirus lockdown going on and I don't know a tax professional or who to trust with it.  Maybe next year.

I feel relief having that done and being sure that I don't owe a big sum there.  In fact, I'm getting a return even after applying some towards my first quarter estimates.  So, now I can comfortably spend that stimulus money.

Next up, city taxes.  For another day.
