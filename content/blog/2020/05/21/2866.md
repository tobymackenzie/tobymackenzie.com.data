The ending of *Mr.  Robot* episode 4-12 was kind of hard to take.<!--more-->  It tainted my view of our hero, who had hitherto fought very hard for ethics against perceived evil.  It was rash, stupid, a bit out of character (though his character can be unstable), and hard to not consider evil.  I can't see him figuring out how to successfully live in that different world, which he doesn't know, where paranoia, perpetual pain, disconnect don't fit.  I can't see him mentally and emotionally and practically make it work.  He was built for a certain world, perfect for it in a way.  Not for the one he's taking from someone who seemed to be for it.  He seemingly hadn't learned from the last game he played.  So, even if it wasn't real or something like that, it tainted my view.
