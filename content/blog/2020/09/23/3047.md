It went from summer-like to fall-like temperatures fairly quickly.<!--more-->  I had been letting my house get a little chilly overnight for like a week.  Finally turned my furnace on Friday night with the house getting down to 70 before I went to bed, and have had it on since.  I had my AC up at 80 for the summer temperatures, so it's been a change, but I'm adjusting.

It's luckily supposed to warm back up somewhat this weekend, as I'm going on a camping trip.
