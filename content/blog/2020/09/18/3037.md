The Browns were on broadcast TV tonight.  And I noticed early enough to watch half of the game.  And they won.<!--more-->  Nice.  Ended a little closer and was a bit more stressful than it could've been perhaps, but they mostly played well.  I didn't catch their first game, but I saw that they lost handily.  Hopefully this game is them getting back on track, and they can continue winning.  Go Northeast Ohio sports ball.
