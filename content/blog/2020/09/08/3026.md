Lots of rain today.<!--more-->  This summer has been pretty dry.  We seem to have gotten the vast majority of the rain of the last couple months in two rains over the last few weeks.  The grass was getting somewhat brown.  This has also made for less mowing.  Some of the plants in my garden didn't make it even with my occasional watering.  Even some weeds dried up.  Hopefully this will perk everything up.

It was fairly stormy, with loud thunder that woke me up early and shook the house for much of the day.  There were occasional fluctuations in the lights, but the electricity never went out.  There were supposed to be strong winds, but they didn't seem bad here.

I hear there was some significant flooding, especially up toward the lake.  I didn't leave the house, so I'm not sure about down here.  Nothing in my yard and my basement seemed to stay dry.
