Oh**I**o **voted**.<!--more-->  They changed the sticker.  I voted this morning before work.  I normally vote after, but I was worried there would be lines and waiting.  Not so this morning.  No line at all and booths to spare.  Seemed about perfect with workers and booths and voters to have an unimpeded flow but still look like plenty of people are voting.  An important election.  Hopefully all goes well.
