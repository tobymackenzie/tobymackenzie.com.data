Black Friday 2020
=================

I probably spent more this Black Friday than any previous one.  I bought four things, all of which I had already been planning to get and only one of which was on sale.<!--more-->  I got:

- [Eureka Timberline 2XT tent](https://eurekacamping.johnsonoutdoors.com/tents/backpacking/timberline%C2%AE-sq-2xt-2-person-tent):  I had wanted one to increase comfort via spaciousness and height over my tiny Midori tent after feeling cramped on recent camping trips.  I waited until it was on sale, and also got the fitted ground cover for slightly less than the normal cost of the tent by itself.  I could have gotten it a little bit cheaper on Amazon but wanted to ensure Eureka got more of my money.
- [*Columbo: The Complete Series* DVDs](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B64Z7HQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  I've been watching this show occasionally on TV and Prime.  Both have ads.  TV has a specific schedule.  Prime doesn't have the later seasons and uses up my data.
- [Contour legacy knee pillow](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MFN8FRT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1): I've been using a regular pillow, which only works so so.  Hoping this improves things and helps with pain and comfort.
- [*Chrono Trigger* piano sheet music](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/4810826554/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1): My favorite video game sound track.  I've been trying to get better at keyboard playing and hope having something I like that much will motivate me.

The tent was the majority of the spending, but it's the more expensive sale items that yield the greater savings.  I spent some time looking at headphones and convertible laptops, but didn't make up my mind or find enticing enough deals on those.  Perhaps for Cyber Monday.
