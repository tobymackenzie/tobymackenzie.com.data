First snow of the year.<!--more-->  It was enough for a solid coating on the deck and grass, maybe a half inch or so, but not to stick to the roads.  It was a cold and windy day, enough to knock out the power for a Cleveland friend.  I'm not looking forward to the impending cold season.  Fortunately, it isn't fully here yet:  The forecast calls for temperatures to go back up into the 50s and 60s in the next few days and last into next week.
