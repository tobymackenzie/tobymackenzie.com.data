Happy Thanksgiving.<!--more-->  This will be my first Thanksgiving alone (I'm pretty sure).  Covid in general and our normal hosts planning to spend Thanksgiving with their daughter's family in southern Ohio nixed our plans for the regular full family gathering.  So our five member nuclear family planned to have Thanksgiving at my parents' house.  That was nixed when some of our members got covid themselves.

So here I am, with something like a normal day off, except that I bought some sliced turkey, a baked potato, and some stuffing for dinner.  Besides that, I will probably get some things done around the house.  If it's not too wet outside, I will plant some bulbs, hopefully finish them.  Maybe work on personal dev projects or other things I want to get around to.  To enjoy the holiday, maybe I'll go on a short hike.  Probably watch a movie.
