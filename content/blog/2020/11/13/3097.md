Healthcare.gov's rating system seems to only have two options: not rated or 3/5 stars.<!--more-->  I've looked through all 56 plans available to me, and none have any other rating.  I don't really know why that is.  Perhaps there's a bug.  Perhaps they didn't finish implementing the feature but needed to fake it until they make it.  Perhaps their survey format leads to an extreme bias towards the middle.  But it makes the ratings quite worthless.
