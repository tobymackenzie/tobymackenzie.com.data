I was not expecting this much snow again this cold season.<!--more-->  Recent nights had been cold and there was a brief bit of snow Wednesday or Thursday, but days had generally been in the 50s and 60s.  Yesterday, I woke up to a solid white coating of a good inch on the ground though.  None on the roads, but on the grass, roofs, and my deck.  Luckily, temperatures went right back up.
