With this lockdown / coronavirus stuff going on, I apparently forgot to pay my electric bill.<!--more-->  In part I think it was the breaking of routine and blending together of days that the situation creates.  Also, the large number of emails I seem to be getting suddenly.

I noticed it the day after it was due.  Luckily, with the coronavirus stuff, First Energy is waving late fees.  So, no harm done.  That flickering of my lights recently was only the crazy winds we've been having.
