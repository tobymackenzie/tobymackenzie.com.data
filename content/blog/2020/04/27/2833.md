I watched the first episode of [*Tales from the Loop*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Loop).<!--more-->  If the whole series uses music by [Phillip Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass), it's worth watching just for that.  I like his stuff.  It is used quite well to set the mood for this episode.  The show is also sci-fi, my favorite genre.  It has been interesting so far.  We'll see where it goes.
