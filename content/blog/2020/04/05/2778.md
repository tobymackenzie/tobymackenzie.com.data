I went for a hike on the Dogwood in the nice warm weather today.<!--more-->  There were a number of people lying in the grass, playing frisbee, etc. in the field near the trailhead.  Less people out on the trail itself than I would've expected though.  It was a nice walk, but it wore me out more than usual for some reason.

Plants continue to spring forth.  I also saw two pileated woodpeckers pretty close up.  As usual when they see humans though, they hid and then flew off when they got the chance.  I see them by my house sometimes, but haven't seen one close in a while.
