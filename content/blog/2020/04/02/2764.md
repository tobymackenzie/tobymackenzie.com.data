I left my yard today for the first time in almost 168 hours.<!--more-->  I took a hike, one week after the last time I had same trail (Dogwood).  It was chilly and I almost wanted my winter coat instead of my thinner jacket.  There were, again, humans, but not very many.  The ground was, luckily, dry.  I took the first half at a brisk pace, perhaps a little too brisk, and had to slow down for the last portion.

As I came up a hill and around a bend, I saw some fallen trees.  Most looked old, but I smelled sawdust.  I saw a tall splintered stump near the next curve.  As I approached, I saw a big, freshly cut fallen tree that would've been across the path.  Then I saw another big fallen tree on the opposite side of the path, with the roots pulled out of the ground to make a hole.  The one presumably cracked and fell, hitting the other.

It was good to get out there after being cooped up for so long.  I should get out more, but there's a bit more worry about going out than usual, and I kind of wanted to see if I could keep going.  A week is long enough though.  I'll not be staying in this next one, as I need resupply and have other tasks to do.
