I got stimulated last Wednesday.<!--more-->  Uncle Sam deposited directly into my account a little more than a normal paycheck for me.  Uncle Sam may be getting it right back, as I still have to sort my taxes, including first quarter estimates, which can easily add up to more than the stimulus amount.  Regardless, it obviously helps my situation.  Perhaps it will help towards some purchases I've been considering for a while, like a new laptop or a mattress.
