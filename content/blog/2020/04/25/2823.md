Today I learned that PHP's [`mkdir()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mkdir.php) with the octal permission argument apparently doesn't support any value other than `0` in the leftmost octal spot (where setuid, setgid, and sticky bit go).<!--more-->  If you try something like `2755` or `'2755'`, it will interpret it as or typecast it to an integer, and your permissions will end up very different than what you want.  An octal in PHP is just a special language format to define a regular integer, where you put a `0` at the beginning of a number.  So `02755` is the PHP octal to match octal `2755`.  This sets the `755` correctly, but it still doesn't handle the `2` spot at all.  I'm not sure why.  I guess that has to be done after the fact.
