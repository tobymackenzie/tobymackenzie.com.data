In light of the current situation, I have decided to re-read *\[Andromeda Strain\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Andromeda\_Strain)*.<!--more-->  I read it last in highschool and remember liking it.

In particular, I remember the highly secure and contained lab facility they used in it, with multiple levels of decontamination and a nuclear explosive in case of a breach.  Decontamination at the more secure levels includes submersion in chemical baths.  I often think of this when I think of [high level CDC facilities (eg BSL-4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level#Biosafety_level_4), but they aren't that extreme.  I'm sure there are secret government facilities that extreme somewhere.

I'm about halfway through, and with all my time at home, should finish it soon.  Though I do have some projects and resupply runs in the plans.
