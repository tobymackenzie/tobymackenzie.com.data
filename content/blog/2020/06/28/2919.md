The third and likely final [art auction](https://racheldavisfinearts.com/auctions/1-2N1B1T/prints-and-drawings-at-online-auction-sale-223) with pieces from my Uncle Joe's estate happened today.<!--more-->  His were lots 15, 76, 259, 277, 278, 279, 279A, 280, 281, 284, 287, 290, 299, 318, and 323.  Joe had several [Salvador Dalí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD) pieces in it.  Joe's pieces once again varied in how well they did but altogether went for a little over the midpoint of the average estimated values of them all.  It brought in about half of the previous auction because of the smaller number of pieces and lower value.

I bid on two pieces, but only [got one](https://racheldavisfinearts.com/lots/view/1-322YWE/salvador-dali-wood-engraving), with a single bid.  It's one of the Salvador Dalí's, in fact, the least valuable of them.  It's a print from a wood carving called [A Logician Devil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Logician_Devil), itself one of numerous pieces produced by him for [an illustrated release of Dante's *Divine Comedy*](https://www.lockportstreetgallery.com/dali/salvador-dali-divine-comedy/), of which quite a few were made.  I don't really know if this was one of the original printings or some later reproduction or what.  I hope it's something "authentic" in some way.  But anyway, it's cool to have a Dalí piece of some sort.
