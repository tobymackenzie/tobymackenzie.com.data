RIP Aunt Jan
============

RIP Aunt Jan.<!--more-->  I knew you were having health problems, but hadn't realized your time was so close.  I hadn't seen you as much in recent years as I used to.  It's too bad my last memory of you is your getting sick at Christmas dinner.  But there are plenty of better memories from earlier.
