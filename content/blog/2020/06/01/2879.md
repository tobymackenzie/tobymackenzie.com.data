I think I saw the ISS (space station) tonight, on the day the Space X Dragon capsule docked with it.<!--more-->  I went out at 22:40, remembering exactly one minute after the time when the news anchor had said it would be visible earlier in the 10 o'clock news.  The sky was nice and clear.  I almost immediately saw a bright star-like light moving slowly across the sky.  It took a while to move behind the trees, where I could no longer see it.  Just before reaching them, it started to fade and shrink, similar to a satellite flare.  As far as I know, this was the first time I saw the ISS, and a good day to do it.  Thank you, channel 43 weather lady.
