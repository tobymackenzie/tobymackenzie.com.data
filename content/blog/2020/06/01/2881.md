This weekend saw more movement on my Uncle's estate, with the [third estate sale](https://www.estatesales.net/OH/Parma-Heights/44130/2536071) and [second art auction](https://racheldavisfinearts.com/auctions/1-2H0T82/fine-decorative-arts-at-online-auction-sale-222).<!--more-->  I bought stuff from both.

Art auction
-----------

The art auction went well enough, considering the virus situation.  Joe's pieces went just slightly above the average total of all estimates.  Most went below, but a few went above, particularly the last two, which were silver dishes.  His were lots: 174, 186, 191, 198, 200A, 201, 207, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 229, 230, 231, 237, 253, 254, 256, 260, 280, 281, 284, 291, 294, 296, 299, 323, 352, 367, 406, and 407.  I bid on five pieces through their website, winning two.  They were:

- [*Heading Out*](https://racheldavisfinearts.com/lots/view/1-2YB2F0/richard-wagner-oil), a ship painting by Richard Wagner
- [*Three Figures on a Street*](https://racheldavisfinearts.com/lots/view/1-2YB2GC/louise-friedman-oil) by Louise Friedman, a painting of mysterious cloaked figures

I bid below the estimates, but nobody else seemed to bid on them.  I was disappointed that, when putting a max number before the auction actually happened, it started one increment below.  I could've gotten it for lower had I known and bid manually, or maybe I would've roped somebody else into bidding and going higher.  Oh well, it's going to the family pool.

I had been interested in and bid on [an abstract bird painting](https://racheldavisfinearts.com/lots/view/1-2YB2EE/20th-c-american-school-watercolor), but didn't get it.  Like last time the bidding ended on my high bid, but because of the order of bidding, I didn't get it.  I feel like I should've gone a bit higher on it.

This being the first time I've won from this place, I'm going to have to figure out how to pay and get my items.  They didn't send me an email or anything about it, and I don't see anything on their website.
