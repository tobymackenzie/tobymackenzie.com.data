Somehow, [my recent upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04](/content/blog/2020/05/04/server-upgrade-ubuntu-20-04.md) switched the Apache MPM module installed and thus disabled HTTP2 for PHP requests on my server.<!--more-->  Running [my ansible provisioning](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/server-tobymackenzie.com/) again fixed it, though I had to (and still have to) work through some other problems with my ansible config that have cropped up since the upgrade.  HTTP2 is working again as it should.
