2020 donations
==============

My Uncle Joe died last year, leaving me and many others a sizable inheritance.  I have decided to donate some of mine to charity.<!--more-->  In part this is to honor him, in part to use my money to support causes that I believe in, since I will be more able.  Each month of 2020, I will donate $100 to a different organization / cause of my choosing.  I will give to organizations that are doing work I value, seem to be trustworthy, and have demonstrated a positive impact, or at least appear to be doing so.  I will post on my blog about each donation and why I chose the given cause.
