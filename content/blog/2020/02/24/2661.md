I went for a nice long hike on the Dogwood and adjacent trails today.<!--more-->  The weather was unseasonably warm.  The trails were very muddy.  Plenty of heavy build up on my boots, and some sliding.

The front of the sole of my one boot had already been loose, and was attached with sticky tack and gorilla tape.  The mud eventually pulled that apart and also started on the back.  I'm gonna have to use some super glue or something.  I had to walk carefully the rest of the way.
