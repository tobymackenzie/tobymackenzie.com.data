Dwight moved out
================

After a year and a half of living with me, my roommate Dwight finally moved out.  His girlfriend got a "real" job in Texas, so he moved down there with her.  His stay here was supposed to be temporary, but he liked the low living expenses so much he decided to stay.

This has been quite a change for me.  The change in my cost of living is quite significant:  My basic expenses will increase by an estimated 34%, not a small number.  This is at a time when I'm about to lose my job.  I have money saved, and could easily get a job at a restaurant in no time I'm sure, but it still could be rough, especially on some of my planned extra type expenditures.

Living alone is quite different from living with someone.  There was someone there most of the time to do stuff with before, but now I have to put effort into finding someone to do stuff with, especially since I no longer have any real friends (he was the only one that I actually did stuff with excluding family).  He had a good collection of movies and frequently rented some, so we often watched them.  We also played card and other games.  It was nice to have an additional person to help with some stuff:  It meant I didn't have to always be there to look for and deal with everything.  It can be very lonely sitting at home alone.

Of course, it can be nice as well.  I can have lots of alone time without worrying about someone popping in.  Dwight could be quite the talker and sometimes would talk for hours, sometimes about things I wasn't especially interested in.  The dishes were a shared duty and they ended up being quite a mess as well as a lot of work.  My house is much cleaner now and I plan to keep it that way.

On the cleaner note, I have moved some of the stuff from my front room into his old bedroom.  The front room had been piled with stuff and virtually unusable, but now it is rather clean.  It will be an entertainment room (video, board, and card games, chairs to chat, etc).  His old room is rather clean still as well, and may become an office.  I hope to get rid of a lot of stuff and make the house cleaner still.

We'll see how this works out.
