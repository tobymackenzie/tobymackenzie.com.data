Stearns Farm Meeting 1
======================

We had our first meeting with our client contact for our Stearns Farm project.  She (Debbie) was very nice and the meeting went quite well.  We got a much better concept of what we will be doing with the site.  We also found that the site will be made completely new on whatever hosting we care to put it on:  It is not tied to being served from the Parma site as the old "site" was.  So the project looks like it will be interesting and fun, and we'll be able to do a lot with it.  I think it will be a huge improvement for the farm's web presence as well, and we should hopefully be able to increase both visits and donations to the farm.

We determined for sure that it is a 501(c)3 non-profit.  I've worked on a number of non-profit websites (including [Red-Cross of Greater Cleveland](http://redcross-cleveland.org/), [Humane Society of Greater Akron](http://summithumane.org), and [OROC](http://oroc.org)) well an intern at [RPM International](http://rpminc.com).  Hopefully, I'll be able to use some of my experience from there to help this project.
