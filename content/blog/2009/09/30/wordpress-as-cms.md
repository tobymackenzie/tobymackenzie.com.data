Wordpress as CMS
================

I've been researching Wordpress as a CMS for potential use on my own sites, but some of the information could certainly apply to the Stearn's Farm project.

Wordpress as CMS links:

- [Wordpress as CMS with 25 Great Plugins - onextrapixel](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2009/07/17/the-autopsy-of-wordpress-as-cms-with-25-great-wp-plugins-designs/)
- [Powerful CMS Using Wordpress - Noupe](http://www.noupe.com/wordpress/powerful-cms-using-wordpress.html)
- [Unfinished Wordpress CMS page - Wordpress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Lastnode/Wordpress_CMS)

I will update this post as I find more information and possibly pull out info from the links.

So far it is looking like Wordpress will not work for my personal plans.  The main reason I was interested was the nice text editing features that I certainly would not be able to recreate myself, and of course the fact that I potentially wouldn't need to write that much to have a continuously update CMS.  But it seems like it would be a lot of work to get it to do what I want it to.

[update] The text editor used in Wordpress is called [TinyMCE](http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/) which seems to be a seperate project that can be integratable into any site.  I may build out my own sites but include TinyMCE as an editing option.[/update]
