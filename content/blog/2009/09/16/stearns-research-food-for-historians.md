Stearn's Research: Food for historians
======================================

We identified history buffs as one of the probable main visitors to the Stearn's site.Â  We want to list local attractions on the site, so I am researching eateries that history buffs might be interested in.

[Here](http://www.parma-oh.com/bizdirectory/bizrestaurants/bizrestaurants.html) is a list of Parma eateries.  I'm not sure if there are any historical places in that list, but I'm sure most of them would be places that a history buff would be happy to eat at.

Possible Restaurants

- [Rudi's Strudel](http://www.rudysstrudelandbakery.com/) - offers ethnic specialties, old family recipes
- [Lydia's Hungarian Strudel Shop](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/16/202824/restaurant/Parma/Lydias-Hungarian-Strudel-Shop-Cleveland)

Unfortunately, it is very hard to find historic restaurants in Parma with a search engine, so that is the best I can do.
