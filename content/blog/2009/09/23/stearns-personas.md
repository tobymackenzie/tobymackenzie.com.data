Stearn's Personas
=================

We developed three personas for the Stearn's Farm website.  They are generic people representing the most likely visitors to the site, and will be used to make decisions in site creation.  The appearance of the site should target these personas.  Content prevalent to these personas should be emphasized, and content decisions should be made with them in mind.  In general, the site should target these personas, though it should still be usable by others.

Our three personas are:  Teachers, Parents, and History buffs.

Teachers
--------

Local and area teachers from preschool to maybe 4th grade might be interested in the farm for field trips.  Education of children is probably the farm's biggest draw.

### Needs

- cost
- hours
- map and directions
- attractions/things to do
- tour visit info, including: 
    - materials available
    - if tour is guided
    - picnic tables
    - bus info
    - bathroom info
    - safety info

Parents
-------

Local and area parents and grandparents searching for something to do with their kids or grandkids might be interested in the farm.  Parents from Parma will be the most interested.  Parents interested in green things or from the inner city might also be especially interested.  Females are probably the most likely to be visiting the site.

### Needs

- cost
- hours, especially the best times to visit
- map and directions
- nearby attractions

History buffs
-------------

History buffs from Parma or those interested in farms might be interested in the farm and site.
