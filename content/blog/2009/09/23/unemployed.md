Unemployed
==========

This is a little late perhaps, but I am now unemployed.  My internship at RPM had been done for school purposes at the end of spring semester, but I had continued on to train the next intern.  I of course had quit out at the Lizard around the end of spring as well.  I finished at RPM at the end of August there, and have since been without a job.

I haven't really been looking that hard for a new one.  I have little motivation to at the moment, and am working on doing some things around the house and some other personal issues for the moment.  I also want to get together a good portfolio before I really start looking.

Ronda Leffel, who is the new director of the eBusiness program I am in at Tri-C, has been and will continue to look for jobs for me.  There is the possibility of a job at Sherwin Williams, who is headquartered in Cleveland and recently partnered with the school.    The program is touted as having a 100% placement rate for students.  Though I do know one who never got placed, I am fairly confident that I'll get something at some point.

I luckily have a fair amount of savings from my years of working at the Lizard combined with thrifty spending and careful saving.  I should be fine for about six months.  I'm not sure if I really want to eat all of my savings that isn't in stocks or cds, but I may risk it.  If I get worried about available funds, I'm sure I could quickly find a job at a restaurant again.
