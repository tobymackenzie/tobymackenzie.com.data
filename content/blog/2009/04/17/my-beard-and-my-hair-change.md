My beard and my hair change
===========================

I've done something I once vowed never to do:  I shaved my beard.  I had intended to keep my beard uncut for life.  This was made all the easier by the fact that it never grew particularly long.  I wanted to have the softness of a never cut beard and the low maintenance.  My mustache has shown that the sometimes disputed notion about shaving making hair grow faster and thicker is true, at least for me, especially the faster part.  I don't want to need to shave my beard as well all the time.

But all of this has seemed to matter less and less along with so many other things as I age.  It's harder to care.  I've been told by some, especially my roommate Dwight, that my unkempt appearance might contribute to my loneliness.  Though I've been more kempt in the past with similar results, I feel the simple but always present change may help to bring about change elsewhere in my life.

I've also cut my hair (slightly) for the first time in years.  Several years ago I gave myself a mohawk (a faux-hawk really).  After that, I've let it grow out long.  I never was able to have long hair as a child, and I wanted to try it out.  I've liked it to some extent.  I sometimes feel it looks fairly good that way, though other times I feel it looks too unkempt and poofy.  It perhaps illustrates visually to some extent my internal state.  Without it I am somewhat visually bland.

Of course, it can be a pain as well.  It always gets stuck in things, such as my car window upon closing or between my back and my seat back.  In the wind it never ceases to get in my eyes.  And in spite of the lack of cutting as well as my infrequent combings, it requires more maintenance.

Anyway, I cut a few inches off to make it a little less unkempt looking and less likely to get caught in things.  I did the ponytail cut, where I put my hair in a ponytail and then cut the end off.  It has created a somewhat inverted curve shape, with the outsides longer than the middle.  I'm not sure If I'll try to straighten this or not:  It works well for the ponytail, which is pretty much the only way I wear it.
