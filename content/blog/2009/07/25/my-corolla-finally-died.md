My corolla finally died
=======================

Due to its rust and general shape, my Corolla has looked liked it was on its way out since I bought it from my brother.  Five years later, it finally went out.  It could perhaps have been fixed, but I didn't think it was worth it.

The death
---------

On my last day of school for the Spring semester, on the way home from class (in the campus parking lot in fact), I ran over a curb (I was tired).  I drove all the way home with no problems.  Later that day I headed toward my parents' house, but soon after I made a turn (Akron Cleveland onto 303) my car started sliding on the front right tire.  Due to a warning that the tie-rod ends were in bad shape, I was expecting something would happen.  I slid over to the side of the road (digging a deep tire mark and gathering some asphalt on my tire). 

I discovered my tire at quite an angle, and found the driveshaft to be disconnected from the transmission.  I called my Dad, and he headed over to take a look.  I called the tow truck right after that.  A cop showed up and asked me about what happened.  He attempted to help me push the car over fully off the road, but it didn't move, even when he used his car.  So he decided to park behind me with his flashers so no one would hit me.  My dad showed up and took a look, and determined that it probably wasn't salvageable.

After a lot of waiting, the tow truck guy finally showed up.  He drove me and my car back home.  He said a lot of cars had had an axle problem that week.  We dropped my car off in front of my house, where it stayed for over a month (until after I [got my new car](/log/2009/07/25/my-new-car/)).  Parking was a little difficult with it there.

The problem
-----------

I jacked it up and looked closely underneath it after several weeks.  I finally determined what had happened.  The frame had cracked where one of the arms connects that holds the wheel in place.  The wheel twisted out a bit without its support, pulling the axle out of the transmission.  The support could have been welded, but the frame was pretty rusted at that point, and a new frame piece almost would have been needed.  The whole car was too rusted anyway, and I had been planning to get a new car after my issues in the winter.  That car had a lot of issues in its time, though I suppose they weren't so bad to deal with (the most difficult problems were probably the numerous busted brake lines).

Gone

She sold for $75 to a tow truck company, with extra door trim bits and haynes and chiltons guides included.  She has been replaced by [my new car](/log/2009/07/25/my-new-car/).
