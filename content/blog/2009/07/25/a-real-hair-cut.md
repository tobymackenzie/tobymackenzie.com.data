A real hair cut
===============

After at least three years of letting my hair grow out, I've cut it.  It was down to my shoulders, but now it's probably three inches at its longest point, much shorter on the back and sides.  I wanted it to be a little longer than it is, and will have to let it grow out to get where I want it.

I started by cutting it myself, and got it just about to where I wanted it in general appearance.  Unfortunately it was a bit uneven.  After much effort, my roommate convinced me to get it cut professionally the rest of the way.  $13 for just the last bit of a haircut.  Oh well, it certainly got cleaned up.  The girl there quickly recognized it as a home cut, and did her best to preserve the look I was going for.  Unfortunately, she cut a bit much off in the back and on the sides, especially around the ears.

It's sometimes strange having the short hair, but sometimes I don't even notice it.  When I put on a hat or lean back in a chair, I often attempt to take into account my pony tail, but it's not there.  Unfortunately, without the pony tail, my bangs now frequently end up in my eyes.  My hair is quite unruly and won't stay combed back.  It poofs up, especially at the top back, very easily.  I'm going to need to find a solution for the eye issue, perhaps I'll be forced to use some gel or something on occasion.  At least my hair doesn't get caught in things, blow in my face with the wind, or end up in my mouth when I'm eating.
