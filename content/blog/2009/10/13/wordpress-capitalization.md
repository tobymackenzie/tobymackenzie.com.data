wORDprESS Capitalization
========================

Hmm, an interesting discovery I just made:

wOrDpress seems to change the capitalization of all instances of its own name, ie "woRdpreSS", within the title and content of posts.  Since URLs can be case sensitive, this caused a problem for one of the links I had on a [previous post](https://tobymackenzie.com/blog/2009/09/30/wordpress-as-cms/).  It was changing the lowercase "p" to uppercase "P".  To solute the problem, I used the HTML escape sequence "&#112;" in place of that "p", and the link works just fine.  I'll have to watch for that next time.

[Update] Interestingly, the capitalization wasn't changed on this post at all, but it was on the other.  I'm not sure why.[/update]
