Applied for Job: Bluestar
=========================

Angela Berlingeri, my instructor for my Web II class, forwarded me an email about a potential PHP developer job at [bluestar-design.com](http://bluestar-design.com).Â  There weren't any details about the job, including information about what skill levels and sets were required, so I went ahead and sent my resume.Â  Julia Brigg sent me an email fairly quickly saying she might have an entry level position (the kind I'd need) in the near future.Â  Yay.

She also forwarded my resume to an associate, who called me immediately.Â  He needed a full time developer, which would conflict with my schooling, so I was unable to meet his need.Â  But he did say that he might be interested once I graduate.Â  Yay again.

Suddenly I have some job prospects here.Â  That is a good thing.Â  I was just starting to get a little concerned about going through my savings.Â  This was by far my most positive job application yet.
