Potential Freelance Group
=========================

I am very excited about this. Â Last week I asked Nadia, a girl from my Web II class who is good with design, if she would like to form a freelance-like group with me. Â She had mentioned earlier in the semester that she didn't like the idea of going fully freelance, being totally alone. Â She liked to have people to critique ideas and collaborate with, as well as to share expertise. Â I had thought when she mentioned that to ask her about forming a group, but my shyness and unsurity made me wait. Â I finally did it, and she said yes, and was excited about it as well.

We talked a bit (via email) and she wondered who else we could include in this group, so I mentioned Jason, another good designer from our class. Â We asked him the next day of class, and he said yes. Â He, of course, was also excited by the prospects. Â And he has had experience with freelance design.

They are both very good at design, which I am not. Â They can do flash and drawings and what not. Â I am fairly good working with scripting and data, and have, and have some experience turning designs into HTML/CSS. Â So we should complement each other well. Â We seem to work together in class well as well, which will hopefully make things work smoothly.

So we've been talking a bit via email and class. Â We have to figure out things such as what sort of business entity to become, how we will handle money (don't want any disputes with this), what sort of contract we will use, etc. Â  We will probably want to become an entity like a partnership, with a separate name from our own, so that we have a brand and people can pay that single entity. Â This will also make sense for tax purposes.

Part of the idea of this is to be like freelancing, but with the support and image of the other members of the group, so we don't want it to start off as something complicated and expensive. Â It is also going to be set up as something that can be done on the side of a full time job. Â We want it to be easy for people to come and go if need be, and maybe even have only part of the team work on some projects. Â Our entity and other choices will have to reflect this.

We've discussed where to find clients, and we may start with some free sites, such as for non-profits, to figure out how things will work and get a group portfolio going. Â Those shouldn't be too hard to find.

We will continue talking, get things going, and hopefully it'll work out.
