Wordpress.com blog
==================

I have created [another blog](http://tobymackenzie.wordpress.com), separate from this one, on [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com). Â I did so as a requirement for the Web Design II class I am taking at Tri-C. Â It mainly stores information about the project we are working on for the class. Â Since it is my first project of this sort, full from start to finish for a client, it contains my first workings and views on parts of the process.

I am not sure how to handle this blog though when I am done with class. Â It obviously will no longer be needed for that, and maintaining two completely separate blogs has its problems, what with increased maintenance time, separated data that all may be related, separate presences, etc. Â It may work though if they have two distinct purposes. Â I'm not sure that I really need it separate though.

Wordpress.com has a number of features, such as integrated stats and greater connection to other blogs, but it has limited features and some important features such as style need to be payed for. Â So I may not want to keep the account.

So I could potentially just merge it onto here. Â I have also been thinking about maintaining two blogs or one blog that has a fully separated category of posts from the front end with completely different appearance and no access to the other categories. Â I would do this on my planned portfolio site for my "professional" posts while I maintain the other blog for my personal posts. Â So I could potentially place the wordpress.com content on the professional blog and move some of my older web and server related posts there as well, maybe after a bit of cleanup.

I am also considering breaking away from wordpress by building my own blog ware. Â This would give me more control over the data, the blog functionality, and integration into the rest of the site. Â But this would take some time, and I have a lot of other projects that would have priority over that. Â Getting it anywhere near the capabilities that I like from wordpress especially would take a while (don't even know how to handle pingbacks/trackbacks).
