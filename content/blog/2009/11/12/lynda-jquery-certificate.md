Lynda JQuery Certificate
========================

We had the day off for Veteran's Day, so I've had some extra free time.  I spent part of it doing some of the other [Lynda](http://lynda.com) tutorials.  I worked on the SEO and JQuery ones.  The SEO one is crazy long and it felt like I was making no progress.  The JQuery one was about double the length of the Worpress one, but I finally finished it.  Yeah!  <del>Here is my certificate for that one</del> <ins>(<abbr title="Former link http://www.lynda.com/home/CertificateOfCompletion/ViewCourseCertificate.aspx?lpk57=2D5995AC0BD8491CB5AC1859A67CECE4&utm_source=LDC&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=link&utm_campaign=cert_of_comp">Link</abbr> no longer working)</ins>.

I already knew most of the basics of JQuery, but the tutorial filled in many blanks for me.  It went over all of the main parts and functions of JQuery fairly well.

It also introduced me to JQuery UI.  That looks very neat for sure, but the full plugin, with the theme and what not, is something like 312kb.  That's crazy huge for a web site.  Some (92kb) of that is images which would only load when needed, but the CSS for the theme is 28kb and the script itself is 192kb.  Definitely a good thing that it is so easy to customize what parts you want.  I generally try to keep my entire page loads, or at least the home page, under 100kb.  That is becoming harder and harder as more images and functionality are expected, but it's good to keep load times fast.

I took some notes on this one, a lot of notes.  It's really just as a reference for me.  I forget the specifics of this stuff very easily and am always having to look it up, even sometimes for things I do frequently.  I'm somewhat dependent on my notes.  So, if I can figure out how, I will attach them as a text file.  No point in adding them directly to this post, they will make it huge.  But I'll have to worry about that later:  I have a usability event to go to <ins>(<abbr title="Former link http://neoupa.org/Default.aspx?pageId=11863&eventId=95269&EventViewMode=EventDetails">Link</abbr> no longer working)</ins>.
