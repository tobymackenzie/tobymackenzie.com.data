Lynda.com Wordpress Certificate
===============================

Our class decided to use [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com) to learn more about Wordpress and some other topics that will help us with our Stearns project.  Our teacher has an account and was able to set up a limited time and course version for us at a reduced price.  We are doing five courses with a little over a month to complete them in.  I was worried this would be too short, but have been moving along pretty quick thus far.

Just recently, I completed the "Self-Hosting a WordPress Site" course, and they gave me [this certificate](http://www.lynda.com/home/CertificateOfCompletion/ViewCourseCertificate.aspx?lpk57=C77C52D48BEE419CA521D8B0CDDA0BF8&utm_source=LDC&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=link&utm_campaign=cert_of_comp) for my trouble.  This was the most important for the course, so that is why I did it first.  I don't know what weight these certificates would really have on a portfolio or resumé, but I think I will complete a few courses just for those.

So far, most of the videos I've watched have been about stuff I already know somewhat well, but there have been tidbits here and there to fill in some missing knowledge and a few videos about things I in fact know little or nothing about.  Some of the videos seem a little long winded, repetitive, slow moving, or boring at times, but they do seem like they'd be good for complete beginners.

I'll continue with the other four courses we have available.  I'll probably not be able to complete them all, but at least a couple more would be good.  We have an SEO one which would be especially helpful, but is also rather long.
