I have finally released my [website snow script](/content/blog/2018/12/26/website-snow-script.md) as [its own repo, snow.js](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/snow.js/).<!--more-->  I had to clean it up a little to be standalone, but it is still a bit of a mess.  It has several different versions, including positioned HTML, transformed HTML, SVG, and the default, Canvas.  I think the Canvas option is the most performant, but can't tell for sure, so I am keeping the others around.  Anyway, if you want to celebrate snow and winter on your website, feel free to use it.
