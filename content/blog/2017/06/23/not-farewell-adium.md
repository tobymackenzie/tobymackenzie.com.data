Not farewell Adium
==================

In March I [posted](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2017/03/07/farewell-adium/) that an authentication change to AIM might break [Adium](https://adium.im/) for that service.  The date of change came and went though and Adium continued to work.<!--more-->  Apparently, the app is able to work with the newer authentication methods.  I guess only very old clients were affected.

In addition, and seemingly unrelated, Adium got its first update in quite a long time.  Just a patch release with minor fixes, but that still shows signs of development activity.

So, Adium is not dead.  Yay.
