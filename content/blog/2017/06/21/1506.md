Looks like I may not be going to [GiveCamp](http://clevelandgivecamp.org/) for the first time in a long time.  I've been going every year since 2011.<!--more-->  This year I had various things going on, was only vaguely aware of the registration date, sort of procrastinated, sort of forget.  The developer spots were already taken when I finally went to sign up, so I am on a wait-list.  Who knows how many are before me and how many will cancel.  But that's fine.  If I don't go, I'm giving some other developer who may not have gotten to GiveCamp in the past a chance.  I'm also giving myself more free time.  Maybe if I can put as much time and effort that weekend into personal projects as I would at GiveCampâ€¦
