Atom
====

I finally installed [Atom](https://atom.io/) on my personal machine recently.  I've been using it at work for quite a while now.<!--more-->  I like it pretty well, save for some speed problems, bugs, and a few design decisions different from Sublime.  [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) had been my preferred editor for probably a couple years before Atom attracted me.  I liked that it was pretty similar to Sublime but open source and visibly being actively developed.

I hadn't switched at home at first because it didn't support Snow Leopard, but after I upgraded my OS, it was sort of procrastination and holding onto the few things in Sublime I preferred.  The polish of Atom and its plugins improved over time, though.  The things I was missing in Sublime and just the difference from editing at work finally were enough.

I added config based on what I have at work to [my dotfiles](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/dotfiles) and made the switch.
