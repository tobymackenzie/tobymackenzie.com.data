End of del.icio.us
==================

Apparently [del.icio.us was bought by pinboard](https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/) and will be switched to read only mode soon.  I created [an account](https://del.icio.us/cosmicosmo) long ago and have used it off and on to store 1007 bookmarks.<!--more-->  Various problems over time and my desire to own my data have caused me to use various local alternatives to store my links, with a plan of eventually building my own system to manage them and display some on my website.  Now I have more motivation.  I exported my bookmarks and will have to build an importer for that format once I get a system built.  Alas, so many things to do.
