Tonight I had a gator po boy at [da Bayou](http://www.dabayourestaurant.com/) in Akron.<!--more-->  My second time having gator.  Both times deep fried.  I like it.  Also, first time at this restaurant (only been open a couple months).  Seems like a good cajun place, though a bit pricey for normal rotation.
