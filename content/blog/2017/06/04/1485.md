Went to see the first [Summit StageFest](http://stagefest.org/).<!--more-->  My boss was involved in the planning, much like Square Fest and Porchrokr.  My coworker's opera company, [Cleveland Opera](https://theclevelandopera.org/), performed parts of their upcoming performance there.  I also saw parts of some other performances, including opera, a Shakespeare play, ballet, and musicals.  All were just bits due to the time format of the event.  I spent time hanging out in my coworker's booth.  It was a hot, sunny day.
