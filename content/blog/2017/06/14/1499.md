Went to look at [Cogneato's](https://cogneato.com/) new offices.  The company is moving downtown (still Akron) catty-corner to [Summit Artspace](https://www.summitartspace.org/).<!--more-->  Hopefully that will give more visibility and bring in some extra business to offset the rent increase.  The place will need some cleanup and work, but seems like it will be a nice space.
