I've started to play with [Dreamcompute](https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/computing/) (basically Dreamhost's unmanaged VPS solution).  The plan is to move my sites from shared hosting over to that before my next shared hosting bill is due.<!--more-->  It will actually be a little cheaper than shared if I can manage with 1GB RAM.

Right now I'm working out the provisioning part.  I don't have much experience with doing that via code / configuration, but I'd like to have a reproducible setup, ideally that can easily run in a local VM and remotely.  The [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is my biggest worry, getting it right without certificate errors or significant downtime.
