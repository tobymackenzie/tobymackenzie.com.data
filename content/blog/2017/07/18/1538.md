Created [a github repo](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/server-tobymackenzie.com) for the Ansible / Vagrant setup I made for my site when I [moved to VPS](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2017/07/15/move-shared-to-vps-server/).<!--more-->  Could certainly use some refactoring and more functionality, but it was good enough to get the server going.
