Allergies hadn't been too bad this year until recently, especially the last week or so.<!--more-->  Getting itchy eyes, stuffy nose, sneezing, and just a bad feeling that I mostly only notice the relief of when it fades.  Being outside in fresh air really helps, so I've been spending extra time outdoors lately.  Today, had at least three times where gunk built up in my eye to form a hunk that really hurt and itched my eye.  Broke down at last and got some allergy medication.
