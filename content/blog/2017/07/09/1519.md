Man, a [sexual assault followed by a shootout with police](http://www.wkyc.com/news/local/akron/akron-police-sexual-assault-suspect-dead-after-exchanging-gunfire-with-officers/455322992) happened not far from my house.  Crazy.<!--more-->  And now I'm trapped at my house because they've got the road blocked off and wouldn't even let me walk by.  [Update: I guess they'll let cars through, just not foot traffice]

Some rapid gunfire like noise woke me up around 4 AM.  I assumed it was fireworks, possibly a mishap, since they've still been going off even earlier that night. But then I heard a repeated megaphone voice that kept me up for a while.  I figured it was something fire or police related, but didn't want to go out and investigate.  Found the road closed when I looked down the road waiting for my dad to come over to help me with some work on the house.  Guess I'll have to find something else to do around the house for a while.
