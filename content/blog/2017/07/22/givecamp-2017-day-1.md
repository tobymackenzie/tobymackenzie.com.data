GiveCamp 2017 day 1
===================

Day 1 of GiveCamp done.  Really hot.  The air conditioning was out in the airport and it really heated up in there.

My project this year is for the [International Women's Air & Space Museum](http://iwasm.org/wp-blog/).  The minimum project was pretty easy and we're basically done with it already.<!--more-->  They needed to merge some content from another website into their main site and tweak some existing content.  Not a lot of coding involved.

There are some additional tasks we have available to take on, one of which could be a big one.  We could rebuild their online store on a different platform, [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/).  I've heard of it but never worked with it.  Might be interesting to learn.

I'm sitting in my tent now.  It's hot, but luckily cooling and a breeze is helping too.  The rest of the weekend is supposed to be rainy.  Hopefully not too bad.
