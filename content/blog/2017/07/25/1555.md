Though I have things to catch up on after [GiveCamp](http://clevelandgivecamp.org/), I spent the evening at an [Akron Front End Development meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Akron-Front-End-Development/events/241275124/).  Heard [Brad Colbow](http://bradcolbow.com/)'s career / life story.<!--more-->  Was pretty interesting.  Plenty was discuss, but a couple takeaways:

- It's better in the long term to build audience slowly through trust and human connection than through quick fixes and marketing schemes
- Making mistakes and being up front about what you do and don't know can create a human connection and draw less criticism
