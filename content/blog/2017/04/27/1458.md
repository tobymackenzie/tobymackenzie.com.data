Moved the last of the carpet I pulled from my house to the curb.<!--more-->  I didn't want to put it out all at once because it would've been a huge pile and I'd worry about getting fined or something.  I also skipped some weeks because it was raining and I didn't want the carpet to get too heavy.

Even wearing a heavy shirt and gloves, I managed to get a little bit of a rash on my arms several times when moving it.  Don't know if it was from the carpet / padding itself or gunk that soaked into it over the years.

Had it piled in my garage.  There's still stuff preventing me from parking my car in there, but this brings me a good bit closer.
