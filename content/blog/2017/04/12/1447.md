I never set up home internet when I moved, and am considering staying that way.<!--more-->  I have a smart phone on T Mobile, their "Walmart" plan with 5GB of data.  With their [Binge On](https://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html), many video services don't count toward data.  Video's lower quality, but good enough for me.  With careful usage and visits to libraries and coffee shops, I think I can make it work.

There aren't that many home internet options that I'm finding, and they don't really have the cheaper options that they used to.  They seem very fast, but living alone, I don't need that.  Spectrum and AT&T are $45 minimum.  That's more than my cell service.  I've seen DSL for $20 from a company I hadn't heard of, but I would presumably need a land phone line, which'd probably add $20 itself.
