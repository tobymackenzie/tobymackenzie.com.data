In a sign that I'm still catching up on sleep from the move, I fell asleep early last night without getting ready for bed and slept through.<!--more-->  I didn't put on pajamas, brush my teeth, or plug in my phone.  The last resulted in my phone dying and my alarms not going off.  Luckily, I woke up right around the time my last alarm would've gone off and was cognisant enough to realize something was up.
