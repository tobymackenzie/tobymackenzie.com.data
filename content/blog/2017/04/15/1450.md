Tax time again.  Finished earlier today, 2016 final and 2017 first quarter estimates.  As always, a relief to be done.

<!--more-->

I always procrastinate till near the end, struggle at certain parts, feel unsure if I got it right, procrastinate more hoping any problems come to me, then get it finished at the last minute.  Yes, the 2016 forms aren't due until the 18th, but the estimates are due the 15th, and they're somewhat dependent on the 2016 forms.

This year, I almost missed an important section, would've had to pay a lot more.
