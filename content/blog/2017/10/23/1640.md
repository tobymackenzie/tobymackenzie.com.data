Got my washer working not long after [my post about it stopping working](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2017/10/05/1623/).<!--more-->  With the help of my dad, we removed the back of the machine, drained any remaining water, then determined the buzzing was coming from the pipe region.  We removed the pump.  It seemed fine, but we spun it a few times by hand.  We put it back together.  It now wouldn't do anything, so we tried a reset procedure I found online for a similar model.  It didn't work, but holding the start / pause button for several seconds did, and it started working just fine, with no buzz.  So, I'm not sure exactly what had happened, but it's working now, and I have clean clothes.
