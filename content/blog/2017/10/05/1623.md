My clothes washer has stopped working.<!--more-->  No lights, no movement, no water; nothing but an occasional, loud buzzing noise.  Stopped near the beginning of a load, so I don't have my blanket or fitted sheet right now.

It came with the house.  I have a home warranty, so should be able to get it fixed for $100, but I'm going to take a look at it myself first.  Maybe it'll be an electrical connectivity problem like my buzzing air conditioner.

It's a Whirlpool, built in or after 2015, so not that old.  A fancy one too, with load size sensor, no agitator, etc.  Sometimes these high tech devices have trouble lasting.

Hopefully I can get it running soon.
