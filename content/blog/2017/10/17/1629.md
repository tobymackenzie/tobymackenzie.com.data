I had feared it, but I've now verified:  Water is leaking through my bathtub walls.<!--more-->  The walls are tile on drywall.  One area looked kind of messed up before I moved in, caved in slightly.  The grout is kind of cracked and is (fairly poorly) caulked over in some spots.

I had seen some moisture on the pipes and in the carpet in the basement.  This morning, I saw wet spots in the floor joists and sub-floor and actual dripping.  So it was finally time to take off the access panel.

The access panel probably hadn't been opened in a while.  The seams were partly painted over, and the panel was quite difficult to get out.  A piece of trim is now quite loose after all the prying.

The drywall behind the tile is bowed and crumbling.  There are some spots of mold back there.  I vacuumed and will spray some clorox in there, but I no doubt will have a much larger project looming.  I will have to decide if I just want to toss on a bunch of caulk, regrout, or tear the wall down and rebuild.  I was hoping I wouldn't need to do anything like the latter for a while.
