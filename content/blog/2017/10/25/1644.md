While working on my site's error pages, I became aware of the [#save418](http://save418.com/) kerfuffle.<!--more-->  The 418 error code was an April Fools joke as part of the [Hyper-Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol) from the early days of the web, but has made its way into HTTP related code and is one of those infamous examples of programming humor.  Recently, there was a minor effort to remove the code from popular code, and a larger backlash.

A year ago, I added custom content to my site's 418 error page, but there was no way to actually trigger it in production, and thus for anyone but me to see it.  In honor of #save418, you can now see [my 418 page](/418).
