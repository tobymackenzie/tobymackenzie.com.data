Had [my clothes washer problem](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2017/10/23/1640/) again.<!--more-->  Stopped in the wash phase and just sat there full of water.  This time it was a normal load, so not related to bulky items.

I drained it with a bucket and then removing the hose, then tried to start it back up again, hoping to bypass dealing with the pump.  That didn't work:  It refilled with water and then quickly stopped working again.

Drained it again, took the back apart and took off the pump.  A nail or pin may have fallen out of the pump while I was trying to take it apart, though it may have just gotten knocked off of something else.

Anyway, it seems to be back in working order again.  Certainly added some hours to my clothes washing routine though.  Here's hoping it doesn't keep happening.
