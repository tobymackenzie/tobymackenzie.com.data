Blah.  It now gets dark before I get off work.  Thanks daylight savings time, or rather normal time.

<!--more-->

I had to use my phone as a flashlight to lock the office door and make my way through the darkness of the building.

No more doing yard work, etc. during the work week now, unless I can somehow manage to get up early.  I'm sure my neighbors will enjoy an early morning lawn mowing.
