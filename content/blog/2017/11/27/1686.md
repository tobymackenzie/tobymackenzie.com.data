I beat [Rescue Rangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_'n_Dale_Rescue_Rangers_(video_game)) (the NES game) with my brother.<!--more-->  Not sure if I had before, but I'd at least been close.  Surprisingly short game.

We started in two player mode, but it seems hard to keep two players alive in that game.  Probably because of the moving screen edges.  We went through most of the game with just Dale alive, switching control back and forth.
