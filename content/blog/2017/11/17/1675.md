Well, Firefox forced my hand by upgrading even though I had "Never check for updates" checked.  So I now have [Firefox ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/) installed.<!--more-->  I posted recently about [why I'm not ready to upgrade](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2017/11/17/firefox-57-tab-groups-downgrade-esr/).

The downgrade seems to have lost all of my history and like a month of tabs.  If I open the same profile in current Firefox, I can see the newer tabs, but not the tab groups other than the first one.  So I may have to switch between the two for a while.  Either that or find a copy of 56, then do a manual back-up of my tab groups to re-import in ESR.
