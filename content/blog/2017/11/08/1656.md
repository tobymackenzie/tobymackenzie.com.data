I voted for the first time at my new address.<!--more-->  It was slightly confusing to find where to go, but next time I'll have no problem.

It's certainly further than it was at my last address, where it was a short walk, but it's still pretty short as a drive.  And it's right next to the library, so I can get more for my trip.
