Mac Update: Snow Leopard to El Capitan
======================================

A few weeks ago, I finally made the jump from Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) to 10.11 (El Capitan) on my primary computer.  I had been using 10.11 at work for months, but not at home.  I was probably one of the last holdouts on hardware that could be updated.<!--more-->  Some of the reasons were:

- software that wouldn't work after the update, such as Quicken 2005 (have no replacement yet), Office X (using [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)), and Parallels 5 (using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/))
- worry about privacy concerns with a more "connected" OS
- possible problems updating iTunes and iPhoto libraries
- possible problems with such a large jump
- general update time and problems
- possibility of worse performance
- disliking some of the direction Apple has been taking
- lots of EULA reading material (yes, I've been reading these lately)

There were many reasons to do the update though:

- 10.6 hadn't been updated for security since 2013 and for general bugs since 2011
- Safari stopped receiving updates when the OS did, at version 5.1.  Not my primary browser, but before the security updates stopped, I had used it for secure transactions to segregate them from my normal browsing.
- Chrome stopped providing updates in March 2016, version 49.  Not my primary browser, but still.
- Firefox finally stopped providing updates in August 2016, version 48.  This was my primary browser and definitely a concern.
- [Calibre](https://www.calibre-ebook.com/) stopped receiving updates at 1.48, which didn't have support for my [kobo](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-aura-h2o).
- [Quicksilver](https://qsapp.com/) stopped receiving updates in 2013 and some things had broken when it tried to auto-update.
- [Atom](http://atom.io/), my primary text editor at work, never was released for 10.6, leaving me on Sublime at home.
- Occasional bugs and probably older versions of [macports](http://macports.org/)
- Other software also stopped receiving updates or couldn't be installed.

Also, the OS had received updates in the years since 10.6, some of which I liked, such as:

- Finder tabs, long desired.
- File tagging, also long desired, though maybe not implemented as well as I would like and not portable across OS's.
- Sidebar thing, quicker and better than the dashboard for looking at a few things (I have weather and stocks there)
- mission control is an improvement over expos√©, though it took a while to win me over.
- bluetooth was really slow on 10.6, and seems to be better now
- lots of other bug-fixes, tweaks, and polish

I was certainly getting to the point where security was a potential concern.  But the Calibre update was what finally won me over:  I got some e-books from the [10kapart contest](http://a-k-apart.com/) that I wanted on my e-reader.  Much easier to read there.

I am not yet done with the update, but I have most things working that I need regularly.  The update went very smoothly, surprising for jumping that many versions.  I just had to [download from the App Store](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886), and the install went smoothly.  I am mostly pleased with the results.  Installing a new OS version always gives a nice, new feel, sometimes more-so than hardware these days, and can be fun configuring.

I have a partition set aside for installing 10.6.  I will either use that for running older software on or use one of the old iBooks I have sitting around.
