Apparently the [ImageMagick `-depth` option](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#depth) is per channel (color / alpha), not per pixel.<!--more-->  It's not very well explained in the documentation.  We had some code written by a former developer sometime before I started (over six years ago) using `-depth 24`.  We were finding that PNG's that the code operated on were very large, yet nobody noticed until this week that a simple two character change (`24` to `8`) could fix it.
