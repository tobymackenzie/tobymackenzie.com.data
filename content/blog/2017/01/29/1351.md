Hey fellow website makers: If you meta refresh to a generic JS message URL for your noscript users, they will see the same message, not your article, if they enable JS.  They will then have to go back to the original link again, if they're willing to put that much effort in to seeing your article.  See this [great ohio.com article for an example](https://web.archive.org/web/20170129095446/http://www.ohio.com/js/akron/newzware/nojavascript.jsp?page=undefined) <ins>(now archived)</ins>.  That `page` variable might make you think, if they had a proper value, it'd take you to the proper page when JS is enabled, but no, there's no JS on the page at all.  Also, who is 'Burlington Hawkeye'?
