Once again had to recover some of my Firefox tabs after an update ([this happened before](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2016/12/20/1315/)).  I haven't reduced my tab count since last time as planned (currently at 570).  Gonna have to work on that.  I think having so many makes Firefox more unstable and slow.
