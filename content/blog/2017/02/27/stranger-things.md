Stranger Things
===============

Finished watching [Stranger Things](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1).  I liked it fairly well.<!--more-->  Too bad it was only 8 episodes.  Sci-fi, cool music, interesting story, good characters, 80's, multiple connected story lines.  Kind of X-files crossed with Goonies crossed with some 80's stuff.  The Eleven character had a similar intrigue to the River character of Firefly.  The story did feel a little forced at times and could've had more depth, especially to the upside down.  They could've expanded the final episode into two without feeling too stretched.  It was kind of like a really long movie.  Have to wait till October for more.  I may have to get the soundtrack.  The theme was cool.  I feel like I'd like a full-CD-length extended version of it.
