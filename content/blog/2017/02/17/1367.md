I have now passed the inspection + renegotiation stage of the home buying process.  As long as the loan goes through, the house is mine.<!--more-->  So far the process has been long, time consuming, draining, and stressful.  I hope there is some relief from the latter three as the bank and title company take over and do their thing.  Besides for any forms and other input from me that they'll need, all I believe I have left to do before closing is setting up utilities and home insurance, and then preparing to move.  The move itself will likely be time consuming, draining, and stressful because of all of the stuff I have and pressure to make it happen quickly (from my roommate and myself).
