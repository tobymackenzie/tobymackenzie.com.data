Barring unforeseen events, I will be buying a house.  The seller has accepted my offer and signed the agreement.  This will be my first "real" house, though I did own a not-very-good mobile home for a while.  It is contingent on inspection, which I will be lining up as soon as possible, and then getting a mortgage.  I'm kind of excited, though a bit worried at the same time.
