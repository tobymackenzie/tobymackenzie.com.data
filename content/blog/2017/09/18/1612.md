Apparently, I had some [`short_open_tag`s](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.short-open-tag) in some examples on my site, but didn't enable that setting when switching to my new server.<!--more-->  Went ahead and got rid of the short tags.  Apologies if you were trying to view any examples and they were broken.
