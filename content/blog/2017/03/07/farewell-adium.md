Farewell Adium?
===============

Apparently, AOL Instant Messenger is [changing their authentication method](https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/02/aol-will-cut-off-third-party-app-access-to-aim/), which will break support for some existing clients.  [Adium](https://adium.im/) is among them<!--more-->, and since it hasn't been updated in a year, this might be the end, at least for my use of it, since that's the only service I use it with.  I've used AIM since what must've been pretty close to the beginning (1997) and likely switched to Adium shortly after its beginning (2001).  Currently, though, I only use them for work, and there was a long stint of me not really using them at all.  I hope an update is released, but I don't see any signs of development activity.  It will be somewhat sad to see the friendly duck and its quacking message alert go.  [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) has a Mac client now, which I may have to switch to.  Last time I tried it though, there were many features absent that I really like in Adium, such as its configuration of events and appearance, and text to speech.
