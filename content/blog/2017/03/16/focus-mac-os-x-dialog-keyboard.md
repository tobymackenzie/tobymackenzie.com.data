Focus Mac OS X dialog with keyboard
===================================

Found an answer to a long standing Mac OS keyboard navigation question: [How to focus a dialog window when it has lost focus](https://arewold.wordpress.com/2007/11/07/how-do-i-move-the-focus-to-a-popup-dialog-in-os-x-using-the-keyboard/).<!--more-->  I often prefer to use my keyboard for performing my computing tasks.   It happens from time to time that a dialog pops up and doesn't have keyboard focus (can happen, for instance, when switching applications just when it pops up).  It has been frustrating that I haven't been able to get focus to it without using the mouse / trackpad.  The solution isn't ideal, as it requires enabling Voiceover (or it can also be done with mouse keys), but it works.  Voiceover has a window chooser that can access the dialog.  Since I don't have Voiceover enabled normally, the procedure is basically:

1. cmd-f5 (enable Voiceover)
2. ctl-opt-f2+f2 (hit f2 twice, opens window chooser)
3. [up / down arrow to dialog]
4. return
5. [tab + space / return to operate dialog]
6. cmd-f5 (disable Voiceover)
