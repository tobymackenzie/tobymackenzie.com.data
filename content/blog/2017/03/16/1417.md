Last year, I wasn't able to go to [Stir Trek](http://stirtrek.com/) because it sold out well before I got home from work.  This year, I didn't catch the announcement and was still able to get a ticket.  There were over 100 left.<!--more-->  I've heard that they had 25% more or something than last year and had to move to a larger venue to accommodate the increase.  Since I missed several conferences I wanted to go to including last year's Stir Trek, it will be good to catch this one, even with the long early morning drive and expense at a bad time.  As usual with these multi-track events, there are many time slots where there are multiple talks I want to see.
