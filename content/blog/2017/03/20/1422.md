Tomorrow, if all goes as planned (though it hasn't always so far), I will finally take possession of my house.  And suddenly, I will once again be loaded with stuff to do, to get it prepared and me moved over by the end of the month.<!--more-->  Today, there was a bit of a scare when I did the final walk-through of the house and there was some damage.  They had run their moving truck into the gutter, and the wind had curled back some shingles on the roof.  There was talk of moving back the closing date to negotiate some sort of solution, and I was feeling stressed, but luckily, they were able to get someone in to take care of it.  Phew.
