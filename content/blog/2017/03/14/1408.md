I've been using [cssnano](http://cssnano.co/) for compressing my CSS on some projects recently.  Apparently, it [rebases `z-index` values](http://cssnano.co/optimisations/zindex/), ie reduces them to the minimum values that have the same stacking context within the file.<!--more-->  If you have other stylesheets or JS involved, though, this can cause problems.  I was very confused why whatever change I made to the number seemed to not be showing up.  Per an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ben-eb/gulp-cssnano/issues/14#issuecomment-169451724), it can be disabled by setting `"zindex": false`.
