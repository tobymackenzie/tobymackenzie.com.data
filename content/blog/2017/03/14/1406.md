Was worried when a Markdown formatted post preview was rendering all messed up.  I use the [Jetpack Markdown plugin](https://jetpack.com/support/markdown/) for this blog.  Apparently, [a bug was introduced recently](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/markdown-stopped-working/)<!--more--> wherein a checkbox was added to the 'Writing' settings for whether to parse Markdown in posts.  It can be unchecked even if the Jetpack setting is turned on.  Easy fix.
