Erm, looks like Windows downloaded something like 1.5GB of updates automatically when I used my tablet for the first time in a long time.  Gonna make it really hard to stay within my 5GB cap<!--more--> for the month, and I've got 20 some days left.  May have to spend some time at the coffee shop.

I now have checked a box "Defer feature updates", which hopefully will limit the download sizes in the future.  I don't see any way to prevent other updates though.

Many things these days are built around the idea of everyone having regular broadband.  Makes it hard to operate on cellular data, but at the same time, it's hard to justify the additional cost of regular home internet as it stands currently.
