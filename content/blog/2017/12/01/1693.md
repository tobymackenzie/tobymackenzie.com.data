Today, I was rubbing my eyes due to itchy allergies, when I saw what looked like little light dots swirling near the bottom of my field of vision.<!--more-->  They looked like they were really there, but they followed my eye movement.  Obviously from rubbing my eyes too much.

I've had the big colored blobs that are most noticeable when closing my eyes from rubbing them before, but never anything like this.  Both are a reminder that it's probably not a good idea to rub my eyes a lot.  When I remember, I try to blink instead.
