I was getting a white screen with 200 status in production after updating Symfony to [3.4](http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-3-4-0-released).<!--more-->  There was a silent error, "Cannot declare class appProdProjectContainer, because the name is already in use".  Not sure why the error was getting swallowed or why a normal cache clear didn't handle it.

A simple `rm -rf var/cache/prod/*` fixed it.  Not part of my normal deploy, though maybe it should be.

The Symfony part of my site was down for a day, since dev was working fine, and I forgot to check prod.
