Christmas is fast approaching and, as usual, I haven't gotten presents yet.<!--more-->  I only have 4-5 people to buy for, but I pretty much always spend a lot of time trying to think of what to get, walking around various stores, and end up buying at the last minute.  Probably nearing the end of when I'd safely be able to order online, so I'll probably have to buy in person.
