Merry Christmas.<!--more-->

Glad to get a white one.  I think it's been quite a while since we've had one, at least a solid coating.

As usual, it and the days leading up to it have been a bit busy:  buying gifts, hanging out with some old friends, baking, meal prep.  I was up till 4 am last night after a couple baking problems.

Good food, but too much, especially desserts.  There were so many that we barely put a dent in any given one.  May have to freeze some and take some into work.
