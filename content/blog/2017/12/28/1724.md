I spent numerous hours looking into what appear now to be separate gzipping issues / non-issues with my site.<!--more-->

I swear when I started looking, `mod_deflate` wasn't gzipping any requests going through PHP.  It still isn't for `HEAD` requests (eg `curl -I --compressed`), but now is for `GET` requests (eg the browser and `curl -i --compressed`).  I'm pretty sure it used to work for the former, which led me to confusion in all my testing.  I did all kinds of playing with `AddOutputFilterByType` and `FilterProvider`, 'php.ini', and other configuration fruitlessly and, apparently, purposelessly.

It still isn't gzipping error responses, eg 404's and 500's.  I know it did before because I was using [a script to check the size difference](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2016/02/25/check-request-compression-savings/) when making some changes to my error pages in October.  I haven't been able to figure out why it no longer is.  I worked hard to make sure my 404 page was small, and now the transfer is actually larger than my gzipped home page.
