First real snow of the year.<!--more-->

First snowy commute to my new home.  Took 50 minutes for what would normally be 15-20 minutes.  Stop and go across the Y bridge took forever.  May have to use Market those days.

First snowy drive with my new tires.  I don't fully have a feel for them yet, but they are definitely well better than my previous tires.

First snow shoveling at the new home.  Fairly easy.  No sidewalk.  Two simple walkways, two short sets of stairs and landings, and a driveway.  Annoyingly, seems the street plow pushes its snow right in front of my drive.

First use of my garage to block snow from landing on my car.  Nice.  I woke up late this morning, and wasn't made more late by cleaning off my car.
