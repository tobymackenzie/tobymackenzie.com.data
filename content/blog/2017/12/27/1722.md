Was going to wash dishes and clean the kitchen tonight from Christmas operations, but my water went out for a couple hours after work, and I haven't been able to fully get rid of air and yellow in it since.<!--more-->  Now I'm probably too tired.

I guess I can at least be appreciative of the workers out in the freezing temperatures fixing whatever they were fixing until like 21:00, assuming it was a problem with the city lines.
