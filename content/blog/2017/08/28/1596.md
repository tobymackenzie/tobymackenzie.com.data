Saw The Planets, Dvor√°k's violin concerto, and a Paganini solo with the [Cleveland Orchestra at Blossom Saturday](https://www.clevelandorchestra.com/17-blossom--summer/17-blossom-festival---concerts/2017-08-26-the-planets/?performanceNumber=15766).<!--more-->  Last concert of the season for me and it was really good.  I really like The Planets and had seen the [Akron Symphony perform it](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2016/10/17/the-planets-so/) as well.  Can hear lots of parts that sound like they really influenced sci-fi and movie music in general.

Went with my brother and his girlfriend, had takeout from [Shawarma Brothers](https://www.yelp.com/biz/shawarma-brothers-cuyahoga-falls) on the lawn.  My dad was there too, but he sat in the pavilion.
