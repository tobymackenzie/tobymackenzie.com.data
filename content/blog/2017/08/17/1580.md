Saturday, I spent some time watching for meteors from the [Perseid meteor shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids).<!--more-->  I saw 10 meteors, though only 2 in my direct line of site.  I would call 3 of them big, 3 medium, and 3 small.

The sky was clear and the moon was behind the trees.  Unfortunately, much of the sky was also behind trees.  I read that the shower was to the North-East, which was well blocked by trees from my yard.  They were few and far between, and I had to spend quite a bit of time staring at the sky.
