Yars are on hiatus
==================

John had stated concern after the Khameleon show about having enough time for the band with school coming up.  This came to bear when he told Dwight he was quitting the band.  Luckily, he then decided to only take a break.  So the Yars are not playing for now, perhaps all the way through the school year.  The November 30th show is still on with both John and Jesse, but Yars Presents at the ECC is cancelled for now.
