Shows Again
===========

We were on a three month break from shows while working on our demo and some new songs. Now we're back. In less than two weeks, we played three shows: Annabell's, the ECC, and Klub Kameleon. It was our first visit to Annabell's: we will probably play there again. We also met a band we will probably play with again called Mario Speedwagon.

All three shows were payed gigs, possibly paving the way for us actually making money with this venture, and perhaps some new band equipment.

We've got two more shows lined up in the coming months already, and possibly more will come, so watch for us.
