******** Walls **********/

        /******** Interior Panels **********/

able to attach and detach large and small items without damaging walls

able to flip panels - one side's black, one's white

air and water tight seems, retained upon removal then replacement

water proof material

resists basic scratching, denting, and breaking from common bumping while moving stuff

somehow deals with problem of holes for lightswitches, outlets, etc needing to be made and unmade
