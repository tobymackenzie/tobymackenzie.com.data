commune
=======

After noticing how much time I spend doing things like cooking and washing dished, I'd somewhat like to live in a commune, a group of people providing members needs efficiently.  Everyone would likely live in an efficiently designed apartment like building.

People would be free to leave at anytime, join (back) in any time space is available.  They may also move to other communes around the country/world anytime space is available.

In its simplest form, this would merely be a large shared living quarters.  Each person would have their own private room for a bed, personal possesions, etc.  
-Bathrooms could be in each room or, to be much more efficient, on each floor.  They would be much more private than standard public restrooms, with rooms for each facility.  Bathing rooms would be seperate from toilet rooms.  
-There would be a large restaurant type kitchen servicing the whole place.  Food would be purchased as used from the full-sized store of regular goods.  Any irregular goods could be specially ordered and made regular if needed.  The amounts being ordered would be closely monitored to ensure nothing runs out while nothing spoils.  
-Community spaces would be provided for playing sports and table-games, watching tv and movies and playing video games, conversing, and other such liesure activities.
-Many commonly used items would be purchased by the entire community for their benifit.  The proper amounts for the demand would be monitored.  Tools for automotive work and carpentry would be available, with a garage and workshop.  Cards, board games, some sporting equipment, tvs, and furniture would be purchased for the community areas.  Some cleaning implements, such as vacuums, mops, and brooms would be available for use.

Cooks, dishwashers, and community area maids may be wanted to be payed for by community members to provide their services and allow others to concentrate more fully on their own lines of work.  Cooks would cook to order some meals or take orders in advance to allow for better planning.  Or a more 24-hour cafeteria like approach could be used, where choices of meals would be available, plus a set selection of items always there.  These personnel would be paid by the system, either not bringing in money from the outside at all, or working short enough hours to still allow an outside job.

In a much more involved commune, in which many more of the needs of the community would be provided 'in-house', the less specialised jobs would be shared among a lot of people: cook one meal, dishwash for a bit, work on committee for calculating how much food should be ordered next for a bit.  This would ensure no-one is forced into doing undesirable jobs all the time.
