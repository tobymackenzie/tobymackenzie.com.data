apple to use Intel?
===================

I say boo.  After all these years of touting the advantages of the PowerPC, I've really come to prefer them.  Some have pointed out that Intel is doing well with mobile processors, but I think the PowerPC is doing well enough:  good computing to power consumtion ratio as compared to Pentiums anyway.  Via I am more interested in for mobile devices.

 For numerous reasons, this is a very odd change for Apple, and their reasons don't seem to make much sense.  There is [speculation](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050609.html) that Apple is covertly making this change-over to later announce it has been bought by Intel.  I wouldn't have put any thought into it, except for the extreme oddity of the move on Apple's part.  Still seems a little far fetched, but it would certainly explain Apple's recent decision.
