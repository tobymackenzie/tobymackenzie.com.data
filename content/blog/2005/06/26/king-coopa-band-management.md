King Coopa band management
==========================

We just found out that King Coopa is in jail.  He got a DUI.  King Coopa, also known as David Cooper, was a guy we met back when we were playing with Double Barrel in the fall.  He was managing their band, and had offered to do it for us as well, but we weren't wholeheartedly interested, wanted to do it ourselves and keep the extra money.  Now Dwight wants to take advantage of management services; he's tired of having to do all that stuff himself and wants to focus more on playing the music.  King Coopa was the only one any of us knew, but he's not going to be available for another 11 months.  Pretty crazy.
