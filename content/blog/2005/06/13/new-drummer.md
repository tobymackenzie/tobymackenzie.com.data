New Drummer
===========

I had been thinking about it for a while, the possibilities and problems.  Two weeks ago, I made up my mind to tell them, but I didn't get to see my band mates.  Rockwood's dad was leaving the house to move in with his (Mr. Rockwood's) mother to help her with gardening in her old age.  Rockwood and his sister, Connie, were thus given the house.  Rockwood went to South Carolina or the like to help Connie move back to Ohio.  So two ECC shows and one practice were cancelled.  Friday was the first meeting of the Yars in two weeks, and I had waited to tell them the whole time.  It allowed me to mull it over more and weigh the plusses and minuses.  In the end, I decided it would be for the better.

I'm leaving the band.  I will stay with the band until a suitable new drummer is found and learns the music or our last currently scheduled show on August 19th, whichever comes first.  I plan to put up flyers in Kent seeking a drummer willing to play in an established band.  We'll probably have them come to one of our shows to see if they are interested in our music and the Yars in general.  Then they can come to our practices and Dwight and Rockwood will talk to them in more detail about the band and find out if they will work out.  I will show them my current parts to the music to give them an idea of the style wanted and also a starting point in coming up with their own parts.  Hopefully we will find someone that can learn the songs and make parts for them quickly, parts that compliment the music well (perhaps even better than my own).  They also must get along with the band members and be willing to play the music already written.  Hopefully by August 19th.

Many things influenced my decision.  I don't have so much fun playing in the band now.  Sometimes it is fun, but a lot of times it isn't.  I enjoy the music a lot, but I don't neccesarily enjoy playing it all the time.  I'm not the best of drummers at all, never having really gotten any lessons on the set (only on individual percussion instruments, requiring much less coordination), and the Yars music would likely be improved with a better drummer.  Sometimes I don't like the parts Dwight or Rockwood want me to play for the songs, or even the tempo or other aspects of the song, yet they may be better off with those changes, and a more experienced drummer may be better at telling what works well.  I've got a lot going on in my life right now, and want to make some changes.  Drumming for the Yars takes a bit of time and effort and ties me to it.  I don't necisarily like the place I'm in right now and hope leaving the Yars will allow me to find a better place.  As my interests are less focused on the Yars and more elsewhere, I can't be very dedicated to it.  Hopefully the new drummer will be quite dedicated and more interested in the success of the band and going places rather than in playing some music for fun.  I am very stingy, and drum equipment and other band costs can be quite expensive; leaving the band will allow me to focus my precious resources elsewhere.  All in all, I think this will work out for the better of both the band and myself.

In other news, our former fellow band, the Living Deadbeats, got a bit of air time on 100.7 WMMS.  MMS plays a 'local bands' type show sometimes.  I was at work and was surprised to hear the Deadbeats popular (to fans) tune 'Machine Gun Sam'.  I was even more surprised to hear that it was on the radio and not a CD.  This means they must be doing alright after we lost contact with them, following the Europe Gyro incident.  Good luck to them.  I'll have to watch for them and perhaps catch another of their shows, as it's been a little while.
