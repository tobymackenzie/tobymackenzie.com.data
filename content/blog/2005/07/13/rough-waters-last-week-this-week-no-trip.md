rough waters last week, this week no trip
=========================================

The title sums it up well.  Last Wednesday, me and Paul went out to sail, but the waves were quite rough.  They were said to be 3-5 feet.  I feel they were worse than the time we went out with Joey and Vince, though he says they were better:  it may be because of the additional weight provided by the two.  We rolled quite a bit to the side at times, worrying me.  When with Joe and Vince, I wasn't very worried.  We motored about for a bit.  I did some motoring as well.  It was quite difficult in the waves, and I felt uncomfortable doing it.  I then motored back down the river.  I attempted to dock, but had lots of trouble.  I tried a couple of times, but found it too difficult to shift the gearing of the motor while carefully manuevering the boat.

This week, Paul is doing some mill-wright training.  He will be doing that instead of sailing during the day today. He's sailing with Ally at 1700, but I will probably not have enough time to do that and make it back in time for my band's show.  I instead will be going on a long biking trip up in my old neighborhood of Lakewood.  I miss the friends and life I had there.  I want to see what happened.
