customized information/books
============================

book store provides customized (non-fiction) books based on customer chosen parameters.  Content taken from large database of information, selected and formatted by special computer program.  Customers choose things such as:
-Teaching Organization/Methods - choose from several basic types of common formatting for transmitting information based on which you feel most comfortable with or works best
-scope of information - general overview of topic or more detailed coverage of a specific part of a topic.  can choose part or parts you want covered and to what extent.
Book is compiled and printed out for you.  Could also be formatted as a pdf or simply a web page.

Based on my desire more generally for a method of storing information allowing people to choose level of detail without redundancy of stored data.
