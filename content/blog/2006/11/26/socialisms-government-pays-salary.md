socialisms: government pays salary
==================================

the government pays the salary.  Everyone recieves a salary from the government based from some determined number, perhaps $20,000 a year.  This is everybody: every man, woman, and child.  This base pay is modified up or down individually depending on what each person does.  
-Children's pay would be based upon their school attendance and grades.  A C average grade with a decent attendance record would get the $20k.  B and A average students would get more money.  D and F students, and those with bad attendance records, would get less.  The system would probably look at other factors as well.  
-For employees, they would either need to achieve 40 hours a week to get the base $20k, or their productivity (perhaps based on a calculated independant contribution to GDP or something like that) level would determine their pay level, with some range of normal and acceptable outputs achieving the $20k base level.  
-The level should not normally vary by more than perhaps +/- 50%.  
-inventiveness and other such traits would reap monetary benefit.  Inventors and discoverors would recieve short term spikes in thier salary based on contribition of the invention or discovery to society as a whole and their individual contribution to the project.
-Money given to children would start when they are born being split between money saved for education and their expected costs of living and small toy costs, which would be given to the parents.  The money would slowly, as the children age, be given more and more directly to them.
-Other incentives and disincentives would also modify the base salary, in a similar way that they do on income tax returns now.  For instance, purchase of energy efficient modifications to homes might increase salary.  The children based incentives would not exist since the children make their own guarenteed money.
-There would no longer be an income tax, except on any moneys gained through other means than from the government.  All government moneys would be raised from other areas.

-Businesses would pay the government employment taxes, which would provide the moneys for everyones salaries.  These would probably be based on the number of employees, company productivity and/or contribution to society, and profitability, and be modified by incentives and discincentives similar to the salaries.  The taxes should start out equaling approximately what companies are paying currently in wages and salaries to employees, and eventually take more and more into account the above paramaters.

-many of the non-wage or salary bearing money making methods should probably still be in existance.  Entreprenuers could still start businesses and recieve profits for their effort and money invested.  Money invested in stocks, bonds, or bank accounts could still earn people interest on their money and finance companies and individuals.  People could still take out loans.  These oppurtunities would provide the market based incentives available today.  The government could possibly emulate these incentives and financial services, but probably wouldn't be as effective.
