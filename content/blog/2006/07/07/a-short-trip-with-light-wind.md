A short trip with light wind
============================

Me, Uncle Al, and Aunt Jan went out today.  We raised the main and jib.  There wasn't a whole lot of wind, and it wasn't at all steady.  We weren't going really slow, but still not that fast.  We went out eastward for a while on a fairly straight course.  Then made our way back slowly with lots of zig-zagging.  There were quite a few boats out, many of them stopped and fishing.  It was very hard to get any speed with anything farther from the wind than a reach.  The wind directiion seemed to change a lot as well, as it often does when it's low, making it quite difficult especially when close to jibing or tacking.

We went back in and ate dinner at the restaurant at the club.  It was between lunch and dinner, so we had a limited menu available.  I ate some pizza.
