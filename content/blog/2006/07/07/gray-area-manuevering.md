Gray Area manuevering
=====================

I went out with Uncle Al last Thursday.  It was quite windy.  The lake was very choppy, so we decided to just stay inside the break-wall.  We put up the main.  I practiced manuevering around a buoy and just generally turning around inside the somewhat small area there.  It was good and much needed practice.  With the high wind, we were going quite fast.  It was very easy to get a good heel going.  We didn't have the side of the deck in the water, but it still worried me.  One thing I need a lot of work on is stopping the boat.  The best and pretty much only way to do it that I've found is to turn straight into the wind without going through it.  The sail seems to really luff a lot though in a decent wind, and the boom can swing back and forth dangerously.
