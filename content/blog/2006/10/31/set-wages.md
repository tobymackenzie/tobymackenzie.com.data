set wages
=========

everyone (that means everyone) makes similar wages, perhaps $10 - 20 an hour base.

-This base pay is determined by the desirability of the job to society: higher pay provides greater incentive to work the jobs.  It may also be higher for more dangerous or damaging jobs, to provide for the possible medical bills or funeral expenses.  Starting workers and easy no skill workers would get the lower end pay.

-This base may be modified on a person to person basis by up plus or minus 50% based on the worker's productivity at their job.  This would provide a maximum of $30 an hour in my example range for very productive workers doing those jobs most desireable to society.  It may need to be watched or held to a curve of some sort to ensure companies aren't giving the positive or negative bonuses as if they were the base pay.

-Number of hours are chosen by the worker exactly, with no overtime available.  Workers so decide how much free time they have and how much money they make.

-Workers should generally be working two or more jobs.  They'd work in both a low and a high profit industry (or what would currently be low and high wage jobs) and the companies would split the cost put toward the wages based on their profitability.  This would ensure that companies that don't bring in much money could still afford their labor, while highly profitable companies bringing in lots would not be raking in excessive money.  For employees, this would provide a more diversified work-life and the chance to get some excersise from work even if their primary job provides none.

-The job splitting and setting-up could all be handled by a government agency to handle the splitting of hours worked by the employee and wages payed by the employers.  It would be made easy to change jobs.
