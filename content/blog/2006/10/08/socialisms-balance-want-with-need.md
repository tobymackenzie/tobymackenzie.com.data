Socialisms: Balance Want with Need
==================================

people want/have preferences for certain things
government could be used to attempt to provide these wants
as in communism goods, jobs, and property are owned by all and managed by government, and these are important areas where people have personal preferences, they could be doled out to those who want them
jobs: person educated generally at first, makes choices as education progresses that narrows them closer and closer to a field they are interested in.  they may change directions if they don't like where they are going, and work towards multiple areas of interest.  government, through good planning, knows what jobs are generally needed, and decides how many openings there are in a given field.  after education, person either takes opening in chosen field, or is put on wait for opening and works in another area of interest until an opening occurs to their liking.  supply affected by demand to some degree: government changes number of positions toward fields people want, or provide other incentives in unwanted fields.  person tires of job, can take opening or wait for another field.
homes: people have many ideas of ideal home and location to live.  government creates homes where people want to live.  can only create so many homes in given place.  if can't get desired location, can be put in closest (based on desirable criteria rather than geographical proximity) available accomodations, put on waiting list till home becomes available. various styles of living accomodations will be made in each area based on demand for each type.  all homes will still be designed pragmatically, with items such as energy efficiency and usage efficiency being important considerations.  all houses upgraded as technology becomes available, considering benifits for the costs involved.
solitary versus group, quiet versus noise filled, rural vs urban
