seperate issues from candidates
===============================

voters take something like the [NPAT](http://www.vote-smart.org/npat_about.php) test, a test covering all the major issues up for current debate.  The results will all be added together to get an NPAT for the entire nation, and seperately for each subdivision of the nation that is having an election.  Each item would be shown as a percentage of the population in agreement with that item.  These results would be compared to each the NPAT of each candidate from each division, and the candidate statistically closer to the division NPAT would be elected.

Some Advantages:
This would allow (theoretically) the most appropriate candidate to be chosen by each citizen without each citizen having to wade through the mud slung by each candidate at the other.

One would simultaneously be voting for every candidate close to their personal opinion set, while voting against every candidate opposing their opinion set.  In such a way, the problem of limited selection from a two party system would be eliminated, as one could vote third party as well as for their major party at the same time, and even for multiple candidates from their party at the same time.

Some problems:
As politicians already can and do lie about their positions on given issues, it would be unreasonable to expect them to stop now.  Especially when their vote is much more directly tied to those positions.

There will be no mechanism to punish candidates for failing to follow through on their declarations made in the NPAT, making the above problem very bad.  Some system for this would be needed.  Perhaps they could be challenged by a large group of citizens if they fail to meet these positions, and have an independant panel of judges decide if they indeed failed.  The group size would have to be set large enough that this wouldn't be happening constantly, particularly by those who voted opposite the officer.  Or perhaps an independant body would repeatedly, perhaps monthly, rate the officer based on their performance on each issue, and the officer would be removed from office or a new race would be ran if a certain threshold is passed in difference between performance and original declaration.  This body could potentially be a randomly chosen selection of citizenry, or even the entire nation.  This would perhaps create problems if major events change the environment the officer is acting in.
