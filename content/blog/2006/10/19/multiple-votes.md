multiple votes
==============

allow voters to vote for multiple candidates in each race.  Each vote would be counted and added to the tally of each candidate as it is now.  Percentages would likely be drawn from the total number of tallies, but could potentially still be considered by percentage of population.

One could then vote for an independant party that closely matches their interests while still being able to put a vote in for the candidate of the major party they would prefer to win, allowing them to not "throw their vote away".  This would give the other parties much greater success, and perhaps eventually give them some power.
