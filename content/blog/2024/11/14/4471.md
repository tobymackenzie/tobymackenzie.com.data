I sold all my Tesla stock.  I've no doubt that it will go up well above what I sold for, but I don't think I want it anymore.<!--more-->  Now that the CEO is in line to be a government official, I'm not sure I want to be involved.  Also the CEO has been slowly going a bit peculiar and doing more questionable things.  The company's solar business is dying.  Competition is getting better.  I'm not sure how well the co will do if it loses government favor.

I didn't make nearly enough from it to buy a Tesla outright, but more than enough for a nice large down payment.  Though I will likely buy a competitor's option at this point.

My cousin made enough to buy a house, as I understand it.  That was a couple years back, when it was much higher than now.
