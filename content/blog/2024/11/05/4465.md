I voted today and am glad to have gotten that important duty taken care of.<!--more-->  I hope who I voted for win, but I will keep carrying on either way.

As usual, I walked all the way there.  My back was hurting some, but I managed.

I saw plenty of cars driving to the polling place near my house plus my voting place, enough that it made it a bit tough to cross the road sometimes.  There was almost no line when I got in the voting place, but most of the booths were filled, and there was a decent line formed as I left.  I did have to wait to get my ballot because, after the guy checked me in but before he gave me my ballot, something came up where they must've given the wrong ballot to someone and couldn't remember who it was, so they talked about it and then he had to go and look for her.  Finally he came back and gave me the ballot.  I also had to wait a bit to put my ballot in the machine.

I voted pretty much all Democratic party.  President for obvious reasons and then others to help restore balance of power between the parties.  I also voted for replacing the political map process that obviously isn't working, the school and child services levies, and the Summit nepotism changes.
