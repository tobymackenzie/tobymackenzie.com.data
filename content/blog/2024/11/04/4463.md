I will be voting for Kamala Harris on Tuesday.  I felt a positivity when she took Biden's place.  There are a lot of reasons I think it would be bad for the country if Donald Trump is elected again, but January 6th ought to be enough by itself.

It's somewhat odd that this particular election is on Guy Fawkes Day this year, with the day's connection to *V for Vendetta* and the authoritarian government it depicted.

If you are a US citizen, please vote your beliefs on or before Tuesday.  It's important.
