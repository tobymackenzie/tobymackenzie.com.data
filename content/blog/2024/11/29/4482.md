Happy Thanksgiving.  Had a good Thanksgiving with a long visit to cousin Paul's.  I believe this was the first larger family holiday get together at someone's house since Covid.  It was good with lots of delicious food.  I ate too much and was feeling it for a little while.

There were over twenty people there, including 7 kids.  This would be the first one with several of those kids.  The event included some of Kimmi's family.  Ally and company weren't able to make it, Vinnie and company didn't come due to mourning a dead bird, Uncle Tom was bedridden, and Aunt Jan and Uncle Al were deceased since last time.  Good to have the incoming kids and new family-in-law to make up for the losses.

I baked a cheesecake the previous day, the [cinammon roll cheesecake](https://www.tobymackenzie.com/blog/2020/12/15/3170/) I've baked twice before.  It took quite a while but most of the bake time doesn't require me to be there.  It was somewhat expensive, with $12 in cream cheese alone.  Between baking and washing dishes, it wore me out, but I was good again by the next day.  There some minor cracking and the icing had some flecks of insufficient blending, but the result was good and quite delicious.  It was well received at the party, as were the other desserts.

I drove my brother, both because his car's been having problems and to save space in Paul's driveway.  Made the hour long drive each way less boring.  It was rainy during the drive out, but not much on the way back.

After everybody else left, me and my brother stayed to play a game of Splendor with Jack and Paul.  Jack won, one point ahead of both me and my brother.

The house was nicely decorated.  A long combined table was set up in their living room with just barely enough room to get around to the one side.  The kids had a kids table in the dining room.  The most striking decoration was outside, a giant one of those blow up Santa's, something like 20 foot tall.  Made the house easy to spot.

There was talk of a major snow coming over night, so we didn't want to stay to late.
