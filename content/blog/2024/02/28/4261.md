It is only the end of February, but an outsized number of recent days have been very spring-like.<!--more-->  Snowdrop bulbs have been up and blooming for a few weeks.  Other bulbs are coming up.  Just today, a lonely one of my crocuses bloomed.  Also today, I heard a solitary peeper while out for my evening walk.  It has been very nice and I've been enjoying basking in the sun and breathing the good air when I'm able.  Weird year with relatively little snow, only maybe three times I've needed to shovel.  Most cold spells haven't lasted long.  And, after a couple months of gray cloudiness, it's been sunny many days.  Hopefully it keeps up like this.
