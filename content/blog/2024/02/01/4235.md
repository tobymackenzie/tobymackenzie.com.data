So glad the sun came out today.  It was quite nice.  There were many days of all gray in a row and it was starting to be a bit much.<!--more-->  Perhaps it's that I've had Vitamin D deficiency in the past.  There was lots of sun today and I spent quite a while outside to enjoy it, sitting on my desk for breakfast and lunch, taking my morning walk, and sitting out with my laptop doing work.  Looks like we'll get more sun this weekend into next week.
