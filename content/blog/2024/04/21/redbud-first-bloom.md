Redbud first bloom
==================

I'm really happy to see that my larger eastern redbud tree has fully bloomed.  Looks great. <!--more--> The first year is often the biggest worry, but it made it through.  It had buds starting weeks ago, but was only started blooming this past week.  I don't know how long they stay in bloom, but hopefully it's weeks.  Really nice to see when I look out my window or sit in my back yard.

The tiny sapling in the front yard hasn't bloomed.  Will probably be a few years before it's big enough, based on what I've read.  But it does look like it has some leaf buds starting, so I think it made it through.  Hopefully it keeps going.
