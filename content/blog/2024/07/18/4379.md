RIP Uncle Al
============

R.I.P., Uncle Al.<!--more-->  He passed away last week, after a long, tough battle with health issues.  It wasn't easy on his children, and especially, his wife, either.  Hopefully he managed to find peace.

Of my uncles, I probably spent the most time with him.  He was a big part of my sailing time.  He also helped me with my cars quite a bit in the past.  I wasn't seeing him as much in recent years, but still, he will be missed.
