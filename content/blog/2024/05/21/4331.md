Had a weird bird incident the other day.  I was going around a turn on a residential street (by Stan Hywet), following the car ahead of me.  Suddenly, something came flying from the side of the road among the bushes, fast like somebody threw something hard, and it hit the car ahead of me and bounced off.  As it bounced back, I saw wings:  It was a bird, probably a robin.  We weren't going fast since we just came around a curve, so less than 25mph, but the bird just bounced far, to the ground.  It all happened super fast, and with how hard it hit, I assume it was dead.
