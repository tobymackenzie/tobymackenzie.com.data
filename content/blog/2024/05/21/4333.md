Another bird incident happened today.  I was walking my brother's dog, Duncan, when he came upon something.  He lunged toward it.  I saw a small bluebird flutter up, but it was having trouble fully flying, so it just got to the height of Duncan's mouth and moved away from Duncan.  As this was happening, I yelled something like "Duncan, leave it" and pulled on the leash.  Duncan's mouth was open, biting at the bird as I was pulling him, keeping him just inches away.  The little bird flapped over to a spot on the road 10 feet away, and Duncan stared at it.  It was chirping.  As this was happening, two other birds up in a nearby tree started chirping at us, and then took turns diving at us.  I pulled Duncan along and the two presumably parent birds eventually stopped diving us and went towards the little bird, chirping at it.  When we came back, the little bird was no longer on the street and one or more bluebirds were up in the tree, chirping.  So, presumably the little one was fine and managed to fly under the less stressful situation.
