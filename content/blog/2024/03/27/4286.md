My Moto X phone, a stand-in for my non-functioning Pixel 3a, scared me by force shutting down and then getting stuck in a reboot loop for a bit.  That's too similar to the behavior of the Pixel.  Luckily, plugging it into a different USB charger and giving it time, the problem resolved itself and it has been running fine for almost a full day.  Hopefully, that keeps up, as I still haven't gotten the Pixel going or figured out what I want for a new phone.
