I haven't been able to upgrade composer with homebrew to version 2.7.7 (on Intel Mac).<!--more-->  It says "SHA256 mismatch", meaning the hash of the downloaded package doesn't match what it's supposed to.  The hash I'm getting is `aab940cd53d285a54c50465820a2080fcb7182a4ba1e5f795abfb10414a4b4be`, but it should be `06e4c4bc6d32b8975174f4f4a0a93476d8907da92a1484c5a8ef138897a760e1`.  Not sure if someone just put in the wrong hash on homebrew's end or if composer did an after the fact update or what.

I of course was able to do `composer selfupdate`, which is good because the [update fixes security issues](https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.7.7), but have had to manually list out all other packages when upgrading with homebrew since it otherwise stops at composer.  If the issue doesn't resolve itself soon then I'll have to figure out how to file an issue for it with homebrew.
