Samba: Site is Live
===================

I've "completed" my first freelance project, the Samba Soccer Club site (sambasoccerclub.org <ins>No longer live</ins>).  It went live almost two weeks ago.  I've got my first freelance pay, and though I didn't ask for much, they liked the site enough to give me a little extra.  They were very nice to work with, a definite good  beginning into the freelance world.  I've hear plenty of stories about troubles with clients, but I had none.  They will have me continue working on the site from time to time, updating it with new content, so I will have a little extra long term income.

The site has already made it to number one on Google and Bing for "samba soccer club" (not surprising), though not Yahoo.  For the Stearns project, it had been Bing that was slow to find the site.  I'm no SEO master, but hopefully we'll be able to get decent rankings on "cleveland soccer club" or the like, things that people who don't know about Samba but might want to would search for.

I've also set up my first [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics/) account for the site.  I've always just used apache log analyzers, such as [awstats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/).  I'm leery of the tracking implications of having so many sites with such tracking scripts, but I think the information will be useful for my clients.  Google Analytics provides a lot of information in a fairly nice format.  Some of the information, such as the detailed maps, I don't get with awstats.  I will have to look into a way to get my clients these stats, since the account is currently in my name.

Hopefully the site will work out well for them and make a good portfolio piece for me.  I definitely learned a lot from the project, and hope my future projects go as nicely.
