Officially Done With School
===========================

Finally, after two months, I've got real word from Tri-C about my graduation.  They sent me a congratulation letter and transcript.  The letter verifies that I have completed my degree.  It also explains that, indeed, they have just one ceremony in May.  I will not receive my actual diploma until June, but I've got this letter until then.  The transcript finally tells me my GPA, which is 3.93.  I had been listing it as 3.8, the last verified number I had.

What can I do with my two degrees?  Hopefully something that involves monetary compensation.  Hopefully at least as much as I made as a line cook.
