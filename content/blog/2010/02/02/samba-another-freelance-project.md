Samba: Another Freelance Project
================================

Yay!  I've got another freelance project now, and this one I'll actually get paid for.  It won't be much pay, I gave them a very low price, but it sounds like I will get paid more from this job in the future:  They want me to be their go-to guy for updating the site and new features.  They will probably have me do things like update dates and add images, so it may be like an hour a month or something, not a lot, but something.

So finally, the project is for [Samba Soccer Club](http://sambasoccerclub.org), a small Cleveland youth soccer club.  I got the lead from Ronda Leffel, the coordinator of the eBusiness program I was in at Tri-C.  I met with them Saturday at Baker's Square to talk the project over.

They had a site at one point, but let that lapse, and now want a completely new site, from scratch.  They still have the URL, so they will just have to get a host and transfer it, or however that works (I've never done it yet).  I'm going to have to do a bit of research on hosts for them, but I might suggest they just let me manage their site on my hosting account.  I've not done this before, but it sounds like [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?568062/green.cgi?tobymackenzie.com)'s version of reselling is just letting us create users for our clients and bill them ourselves.  They shouldn't have too much traffic, so this should work fine.

<!--more-->

The site will probably have a fairly large number of pages, but they will be fairly simple, at first.  Just basic club info plus pages for each team, including schedules and tournament info.

They do want a forum though, which I will build and launch separately, considering the amount of work that will require.  [bbPress](http://bbpress.org/) may be the best way to go for this: It seems to be the only forum app that [integrates users with Wordpress](http://bbpress.org/documentation/integration-with-wordpress/) "easily", though not without issues.  I am also considering building one into Wordpress by modifying an already built [forum "package"](http://pods.uproot.us/packages/pods-forums/) for [Pods CMS](http://pods.uproot.us/).  I will have to look into it, not sure what sort of features, et cetera it has:  doesn't seem to have search.

I've been working on design ideas, not my strength, so it's taking me a while.  I'm charging too little to bring [Jason](http://redgraffix.com), the designer, in on this one.  The design probably won't end up being fancy, but I'll see what I can pull off:  I felt the Yars design I did a while back turned out pretty good, though I did get some help from the client on that one.

Hopefully this project will go smoothly, turn out good, and work out well for me, including the future work I will have on it.
