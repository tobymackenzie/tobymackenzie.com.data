New Theme Again
===============

It wasn't long with that [last theme](https://tobymackenzie.com/blog/2010/01/15/new-wordpress-com-theme/).  It had some undesirable issues, such as the cut off code blocks, no page tabs, and a few general appearance things.  I had looked at this Monochrome theme before and skipped over it because it lacked differentiation for "code" blocks.  However, I've discovered that it does put any "pre" blocks into boxes, and they have overflow set so that any cut off width can be scrolled to.  So now I'll just have to go back and put everything in "pre" blocks, and it should be much more readable.

The theme is very clean and simple and almost monochromatic, fitting better with the current theme on my own site.  I like how post meta information is set to the side in such a way that makes it more readable as well as the post.  I don't like the dates on pages, but I'll live with that.  There is a fair amount of "white" space, making things more readable, comfortable, airy.

I would like it to have a flexible width, so that my code blocks don't have to be so scrunched if they don't need to be.  It lacks header differentiation, but it doesn't seem to matter as much since the headers stand out less in general and the break in meta information differentiates posts.  It uses a fair amount of medium-gray on semi-dark gray, which does not pass WCAG luminosity ratio requirements and thus can be hard to read:  I'll live with that for the other benefits I'm getting.
