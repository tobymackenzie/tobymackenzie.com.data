Post-Suicide Q&A
================

It would be nice if you could field questions after killing yourself.  Then maybe people could understand why and perhaps be better able to handle others in similar situations who might be considering offing themselves as well.  You can write up all that you want before you off yourself, but you can never really know what people would actually ask or who would even be interested enough to ask.  There are many nuances in conveying information, and you probably won't be able to convey your messages in exactly the way that the people you are sending them to need them to be to truly understand what you are trying to say.  There can be no follow up questions, which are usually very important for homing in on what the asker wants to know and the answerer wants to say.  And of course there is no guarantee that the people who you are sending those messages to or who want to know some answers will actually read them.  Reading can be quite tedious, especially the voluminous amounts that a suicidal has to convey and the great boringness it most likely has to most other people.  It is, of course, also tedious to write, and you probably in the end just won't right all you want to before you go through with it.  Most people probably have some hope or feeling that it won't actually happen, and the last bit where they are sure it will happen, they are in poor condition for writing profusely and well.  There is, of course, no way to really implement this idea, just thinking.
