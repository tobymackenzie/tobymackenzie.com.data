Stop Signs
==========

There should be almost no stop signs. In their place should be special yield signs. With these, drivers would be required to slow down to a point of speed at which they can determine the existance of oncoming traffic. If there is no traffic that has the right of way, they have no need to stop, but may continue on. If there is, they must stop until all traffic with a right of way has passed, like a normal stop sign. Most lights at the meeting of a low traffic street would be set on blinking red, which would also have the significance of the special yield sign.
