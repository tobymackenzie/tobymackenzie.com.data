variable heating
================

Heating system will run continuously, providing heat to the house at the rate at which it is leaving. Output will be able to be varied very precisely to hone in on proper heating rate. Should not need as much 'power' (needn't be as big of a maximum source of heat), as it will be matching outflow only.

Proper heating rate determined by monitoring carefully the temperature. If temperature starts to go down, need more heat. If it starts to go up, need less. uses interior and exterior temperature for better control.

Should be able to run very efficiently by running continuously.
