on love
=======

I don't much like love. Love seems to be something not that is real and exists, but a feeling created by our minds to encompass several human needs in a single want: a physical need for sex and for contact; a mental need for someone to share things with, a person to do this with like no other; social needs, both in a need for a person to socialize with a lot and a person that you being with makes you fit into society better by being in a relationship, just as so many others are and so many books and movies says is the end of all means; some others that I forget at the moment.
