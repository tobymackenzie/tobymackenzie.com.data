My political View
=================

I am somewhat of a radical in that I want change, and the change that I would advocate is often a fairly significant departure from the current position. My views are based upon what I see and experience, how I think things should be based upon what I know. I often know only the basics of the topics I am discussing. I am no professional politician or pro in fields directly relating to these ideas, nor have I done research on them, either of other people's data or of my own. My opinions may well change based upon new information that I find out, and I cannot gaurentee them to work well or at all. Also, many if not all of my ideas are just ideas that I found interesting and think would have some potential, but not neccessarily be what I'd want or advocate.
