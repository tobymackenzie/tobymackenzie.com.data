Benefit Training
================

No direct benefits are given. Instead, training is given to employees to train them to effectively use their money to cover the the necessary benefits themselves.

Training to invest money for best return/risk ratio to cover retirement, etc.
Training for health and nutrition. Things such as gym time would be provided to ensure healthiness. Nutrition analysis and training would be provided to ensure healthy diets.

The costs of the training programs should be significantly lower than costs of the regular benefits.
