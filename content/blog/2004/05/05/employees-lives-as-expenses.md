Employees Lives as Expenses
===========================

Employees of a company are treated as assets of that company whose lives are expenses to the company, as would be maintanence of any asset. Instead of giving employees salaries, employees are given what they need to live. Food, shelter, car or bus pass, and other essentials would be covered as a bare minimum. Other extra benefits are given to produce more incentive, as would higher salaries or bonuses. 
Employers would be given the power to manage the living expenses of employees. Lower "wage" occupations would be watched and managed very carefully to keep costs as low as possible, while higher 'wage' earners would enjoy a much more relaxed and free management of their expenses, allowing them to choose as they'd like. 
Managers of more tightly managed occupations would choose food based on nutritional content, giving employees meal plans where each food contributes to getting RDAs of nutrients and the diets are designed to ensure all RDA's are met without giving too much excess of a given nutrient. Meal plans would be managed per individual, giving people with more active lifestyles greater energy intakes and people who are ill more vitamins and minerals that are linked to helping that illness. 
Housing would be a bare minimum sized apartment for low wage earners. Higher earners would be allowed more space and privacy.
Spending cash would be given to all but the lowest income jobs, allowing employees to make day to day purchases of small items they may want. The amount would increase with 'wage'. The money would be given through a card similar to a debit card through a credit card service, allowing employees to use the card where credit cards are excepted and also withdraw cash from ATM's for places where they aren't. The cash would be inserted into an account for each employee that would, with higher wage earners at least, have the possibility of accrueing interest on the balance. 
For lower 'income' people, things such as computers, sporting equipment, and musical instruments would be provided in a group ownership form, such as access to a computer lab, a gym, and a lobby located piano. Higher 'income' folk would be given the opportunity for more personal versions, such as a personal computer, their own tennis racket, or a keyboard. 
This system would provide the most incentive to employees to do a good job if the better rewards are achievable through better performance. Perhaps an employee who does really well in sales one year will be given a bonus of a personal computer, which they may use in place of the employee computer lab. The rewards would have to be tailored to the desires of the individual: someone who doesn't like computers shouldn't be given one, someone who doesn't like cars shouldn't be given one. Management must attempt to ensure that all employees receive what would be considered equal value for equal performance. If an employee doesn't want to drive a car to work but would rather walk or take the bus should be given something else if the other employees have cars. It must be something they want though, and maybe something that seems more of a necessity comparable to a car so that other employees then don't feel jealous when the guy gets say $20000 (value of the cars the co buys normally) of whatever he or she wants.
