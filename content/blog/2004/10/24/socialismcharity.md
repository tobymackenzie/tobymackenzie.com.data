Socialism:Charity
=================

In a free state, it would be ideal if only those who want to and are able pay for helping out those less fortuanate would. Instead of taxes covering social charity type programs, donations will. Donations will be given to government run charities. The government charities will be very similar to free market charities; they will be set up to utilize money to improve a specific problem. People will be able to pick and choose which charities they would like to donate to based on the problems they want to fix, just like with free market charities.
