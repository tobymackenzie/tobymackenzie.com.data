I'm on GitHub
=============

A couple months ago I finally made my first repos on [GitHub](http://github.com).  It provides a good place for me to store some of the code I use in an easily accessible location and also offers the potential for others to be able to make use of it and even contribute to it.  I definitely like it so far.  It has been quite easy to work with and offers a rather nice web interface.  I can now not only access these repos from anywhere (with internet connectivity), but also read the source with its file browser and reader and view commit history with diffs.

I started off by adding some Symfony related repos, three that will form a basis for my personal Symfony projects ([Symfony-Initial](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/Symfony-Initial), [Symfony-BaseBundle](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/Symfony-BaseBundle), and [Symfony-Shared](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/Symfony-Shared)).  I also added another Symfony one related to a project I'm working on ([Symfony-BaseBundle](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/Symfony-SportsBundle)).  Then I added some more generic web related ones, a new CSS repo [Web-Presentation](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/Web-Presentation) and my JavaScript codebase [TMLib (Web-ClientBehavior)](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/Web-ClientBehavior).  I've been working on TMLib for a while now and have been wanting to add it.

I will work on these as need warrants and time allows.  I will probably continue to add more of my collections of code that I'm fine with making public.
