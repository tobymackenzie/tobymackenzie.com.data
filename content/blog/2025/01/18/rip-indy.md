RIP Indy
========

RIP Indy the dog.  He was a mostly good dog.  He was my former roommate and friend's.  He was wily at times and would sometimes make crazy vocalizations when he saw other dogs, so loud that he scared dogs and people.  He loved to play with other dogs when he was young and was very energetic, but became angry with other dogs and lost energy as he got older.  He bit me once in the hand, from which I still bear scars.  I hadn't seen him in several years unfortunately.  He fell and couldn't get back up on his hind legs.  He no longer had feeling in them and had to be put down.  We'll miss you, Indy.
