Ideas: Library after-hours lockers
==================================

Lockers would be installed outside of a library facility, accessible after hours.  If a patron can't get to the library during its open hours, but wants to take something out, they could request after-hours pickup.  A librarian would get those items and put them in a locker.  The locker would have a scanner based lock that would be set up for the patron's library card.  At any time, they could come, scan their card, open the door, grab the materials, and close the door.

There would probably have to be a limited number of lockers so that it wouldn't take too much of the librarians' time, and so that it wouldn't be abused.  The website could give an estimate of when the materials would likely be put in the locker, based on if there was still a locker available and if the item was still at that branch of the library at that time.  A notification would come when they were put in.  It might be an end of day type of task and would not be intended for during the day.

The items would likely be considered checked out for due time purposes when they go in the locker.  There would probably have to be some time limit for picking them shorter than the due date period so that lockers don't end up wasted.  If the materials aren't picked up in a few days or whatever, they would be taken out of the lockers by the librarian and checked back in as if the patron had returned them.  A notification would be sent to the patron.

Libraries have somewhat limited hours, especially on weekends.  This would allow patrons who're busy during normal hours to still get items.

I imagine this would only be possible at wealthier library systems, as it would require some probably pricey scanner-lock systems tied into their main system as well as librarian time.
