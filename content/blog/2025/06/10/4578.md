Looks like my Macbook Air (2020 Intel) will not be supported for the next major MacOS update, Tahoe.  I knew that was coming at some point when they switched to ARM architecture.  Luckily, Sequoia should still receive security updates into 2026 or 2027, and that's all I really care about.  By that point, I will probably transition to a Linux computer for my main, and if I need a new Mac for other stuff, may just get a refurb Mini.
