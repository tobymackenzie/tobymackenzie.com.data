Finally got the One UI 7 / Android 15 update on my phone (Samsung S24) today.  15's been out on Pixel devices for six months, but it took Samsung a long time with this one.  I had bought this phone in part because Samsung is supposed to be quick with releases.  Hopefully, this doesn't become the norm.

Not a lot has changed noticeably.  My most liked change is that I can have most app icons match my chosen accent color (green) which makes my home screen and quick app drawer look much nicer.  There's also a feature which separates the notification drawer and quick settings slide down, where swiping down from the left shows one and from the right, the other.  I'm still getting used to that but may find it results in less swipes.  There are a few other aesthetic tweaks.  I think there's a bunch of AI stuff, but I'm not that interested in that.
