Doing my federal (US) taxes this year, I was finding myself unable to create an account on the [Free Fillable Forms site](https://www.freefilefillableforms.com).  I kept getting kicked back to the start after filling out and submitting my information.  [This Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1amkw2v/unable_to_sign_into_free_file_fillable_forms/) led me to figure out that it was related to my T-Mobile Home Internet.  I turned that off and turned on my phone hotspot and used that to get in.  My phone is also T-Mobile, but apparently different enough to not have that issue.  Later, I was able to get back in with my Home Internet, so it seems to be just related to something on that initial registration process.
