Since MacOS 15.7.1, the touch ID (fingerprint reader) often takes a while to become available on the login screen after the computer has awakened.  It takes like 15 seconds to become functional, in which the user circles do a jumpy little dance.  I know it's ready when the message about using the touch id or password to log in shows up.  This definitely slows my roll, as I lock the screen every time I leave the computer, which happens frequently.
