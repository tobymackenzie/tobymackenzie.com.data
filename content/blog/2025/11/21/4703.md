I don't use `npm` often.  When I do, I tend to be reminded of annoyances in using it.  One such annoyance is that it doesn't take into account the `node` version in use when installing new packages, as [I posted about four years ago](/content/blog/2021/02/26/3310.md).  It just goes with the latest if no version is specified, regardless of its ability to run in the available environment.  So I have to manually step back versions until I find one that works.  The alternative package manager `yarn` at least has the good grace to error out for incompatible versions, so I used that and just decremented the version of each package until it stopped erroring.

Some of us like to let our OS package manager manage our OS-wide software for security, stability, and simplicity, and that isn't always the latest and greatest.
