I went to the baseball (Guardians) game with the family last night.  My parents got us all club seats for my brother's birthday.<!--more-->  Fancy.  It had been years since I'd been up there and I forgot they had free food and padded seats.  I ate much more than at a normal game:  philly sandwich, two pizza slices, salad, hot dog (with relish, which they don't have elsewhere), ice cream sandwich, and peanuts.  Also free water, so I didn't have to bring in a bottle.  The seats weren't very crowded and the cushions were comfy.  The team won.  Starting pitcher Cantillo did well through 8 innings.  The weather was cooler than previous games but still pleasant.  Some of us had brought extra stuff for warmth but didn't need it.  All in all a good night.
