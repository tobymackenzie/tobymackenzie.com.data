RIP Uncle Tom
=============

R.I.P Uncle Tom.<!--more-->  He passed away today after a couple years in a nursing home.  He had wanted to go home but wasn't in good enough shape to manage by himself.  I think he was unhappy where he was.  I hope he found peace.

The most memorable connection with him was him having me watch his dogs and house while he and Aunt Jan went on vacation a number of times.  He had plenty of dogs through the time I knew him.  He had a number of memorable summer family events at his house over the years, the only one until recently that had a pool.  He generally had a good sense of humor.  He liked baseball and music.

Though I hadn't seen him in a while, he will be missed.
