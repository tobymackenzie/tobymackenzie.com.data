Yesterday evening I went to Blossom to see the Cleveland Orchestra perform *Carmina Burana* (Orff) and *En Saga* (Sibelius).  The former is one of my favorite classical works and I think this was my third time seeing them perform it.  As usual, it was done quite well, and powerfully.<!--more-->  The evening was very pleasant.  Maybe slightly hot, but pleasant.

I was originally planning to get the cheapest assigned seats, $35 for the back of sections 3x, but the lady convinced me to get the lawn seats and sit in general admission.  It was cheaper and almost as good.

There was a chance of rain forecast.  The sky was gray.  During the first half, the wind picked up a bit.  During intermission, quite a few lawn sitters moved into general admission, often with their coolers and stuff.  A tallish guy sat in front of me.  I considered moving, but the visual isn't as important as the audio part.

There was a good crowd so that the lawn was mostly covered but not overcrowded like it can get for the busier ones.  General admission had enough empty seats for spaces between most groups even after it filled up more.
