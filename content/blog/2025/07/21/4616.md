Recently, I gave in and set up my work email on my phone.  I had gone the first 15 years at Cogneato only getting my email from my work computer, wanting to separate my work and home life.<!--more-->  But I've been working reduced and more varied hours in recent years.  I was needing to leave my work laptop running a lot and checking it often to have something like regular support hours for clients and other Cogneato workers.  So with it on my phone, I can leave the laptop off when I'm off the clock and get more of my own stuff done.

I installed K9 / Thunderbird just for work email.  It works just fine.  I set it up to receive push notifications so that I can respond quickly if needed.  I set up "Quiet Time" in the app to limit evening and overnight emails, though for some reason they do still come through sometimes.  Anyway, if it's off hours, I can just swipe the notification away or glance at them if I want.

Overall I think it's actually improved my work life balance.  I don't get a lot of work emails though, often just a handful of non-spam in a day.
