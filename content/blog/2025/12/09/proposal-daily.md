Proposal: *daily
================

I propose that, for any word that ends with the suffix "day", the suffix can be replaced with "daily".  The new word shall be equivalent to putting the word "every" before that word.  For example, "Mondaily" means every Monday, "Tuesdaily" means every Tuesday, etc.  Seems a useful shortcut to discuss these.  For example, "Fridaily I go into the office" seems a little quicker and simpler sounding than "Every Friday I go into the office".

Some other example words that seem to work fine without explanation:

- middaily
- weekdaily
- workdaily
- holidaily
- paydaily
- birthdaily

"Todaily" seems basically the same as "daily".  For "yesterdaily", every day has a yesterday, and we might want to discuss those, perhaps similarly to "yesterdays".  "Maydaily" might be used by some rescuers discussing every time they get a call.

Some don't work as well because they aren't likely to happen multiple times for a single person:

- somedaily
- doomsdaily
- heydaily

However, we still may want to discuss them in a broad, society-wide, history-wide or universe-wide sense.
