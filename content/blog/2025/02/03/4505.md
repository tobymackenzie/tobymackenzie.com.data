I'm late to posting this, but I hope y'all had a merry Christmas and new year.<!--more-->  At least I get to include the lunar new year in that too.  We just had the small four person get togethers that we've been doing for these since Covid.  We did a pierogi dinner with kraut for Christmas eve and Turkey and the like on Christmas day.  Dinners were delicious.  I made my pecan tassies for both Christmas and new years and they came out well.  Gifts I got include a weather station, a house plant, a vest, some cereal, and some gift cards.
