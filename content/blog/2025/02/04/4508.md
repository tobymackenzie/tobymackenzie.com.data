In January, I made another of my [cinnamon roll cheesecake's](/content/blog/2020/12/15/3170.md).  I was in a rush and did not let it set in the fridge at all.  And it really came out as a gooey circle of glop.  The center sunk in and it was hard to serve.  Really wouldn't have been presentable if it weren't just to my close family.  I've learned how important that setting is for cheesecake.

However, it was still quite tasty.  It was huge for four people, but it did eventually get eaten over a week-long period.

This one had three changes from normal.  One, I mixed in most of the cinnamon crumble to the main batter in the mixer.  I think this just turned out better and I will probably do it again.  Two, I used duck eggs instead of chicken eggs.  That was all Whole Foods had in a six pack at the time.  They were expensive too, more expensive than the dozen chicken eggs, but I didn't want to waste any.  Three, I didn't put the frosting on top because I was in such a rush that I didn't have time to make it.
