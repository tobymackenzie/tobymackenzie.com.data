My main email app (Fastmail) on my phone logged me out without me noticing for two days.  I've been trying to not pay as constant attention to my email as it is, so it just seemed nice, but I didn't even really think about it in that period.  Happened to have more than the usual amount of emails when I got back in, though luckily, nothing important.  It'd be nice if I could have it only notify me immediately for email from certain addresses or something like that.
