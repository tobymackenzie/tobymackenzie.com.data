This year, my larger redbud tree has only a few blooms on it and seemingly has gone straight to leaf.  Last year, [it fully bloomed](/content/blog/2024/04/21/redbud-first-bloom.md) and looked great.  This year, it went to leaf right away while almost all the redbuds I've seen have bloomed nicely.  It does seem to be growing faster this year than last:  Must be focusing its energy on growth.  So, hopefully next year it'll be in full bloom again.

My tiny front sapling is still too small for blooms and has also gone straight to leaf.  I'm glad it's still doing fine.
