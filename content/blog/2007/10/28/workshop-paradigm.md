Workshop Paradigm
=================

apps + files organized by job/workshop

example: music making workshop has music creation apps + users personal (and other's shared?) music files

different users have same apps (tools) but their own files (works)

different jobs/workshops may use same tools ie music making and music listening workshop may both need some listening tools
