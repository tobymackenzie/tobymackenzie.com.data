Leopard:Mac OS X.5 first impressions
====================================

***finder:
yay, finally can save default view settings, including column width and sort column, to be applied to all folders.  this is huge for me
quickview thing awesome.  been wanting something like that for a long time.
-plays movies and sounds
--movies pop up fairly small, must press full screen button to see big
-text documents readable, probably much better for just reading them than using textedit
-excel spreadsheets even viewable, though formatting severely messed up at times, sometimes unreadable, very slow to open
-ichat logs even viewable
-easy, just hit space to open, space to close again.
-can navigate to other images in same folder with arrow keys
-can put in full screen via button, no apparent keyboard method.  in full screen, hit unintuitive tab or shift tab to move to next or previous items in same folder.  arrow keys do nothing, why not use them just as they were used in regular quicklook
slideshows seem to have disappeared completely.  can view images, one at a time only, in full screen
icon set nicer, easier on eyes
coverflow somewhat interesting for image folders, though probably won't use it.
-makes windows bigger if smaller than certain minimum size
-movies get first frame view, sounds get nothing special
sidebar thing too wide, can't go by just icons anymore.
-search thing seems interesting, but doesn't provide very useful results, as they don't appear in a normal find type dialog where you can refine the results or group items.  crashed the finder once
feels a bit more solid and streamlined
trash - finally one can view items in the trash.  they cannot be opened, but previewed by icon or in quickview
can turn off warning when changing file extension, a very annoying thing unalterable in previous versions
-also, finder highlights all of name but extension (except via second click) when editing name
***spotlight
must reindex upon install, index manages to miss some things such as iphotos
new search results windows finally part of an application, the finder, so they no longer get lost
new search results window not nearly as nice, no arrangements by kind whatsoever, results all bungled together in one of standard finder views (except columns).  no simple buttons for limiting search either.
-image results not nearly as nice, must type "kind:image" after query to limit to images, then use standard finder view
***System
guest user accounts, been wanting that for a long time too.  just concerned about it deleting the guest account every time, may limit its usefulness: if let people login as guest to create a project, they'll need to put it somewhere special so it won't get deleted, as I understand it.
can finally work with groups without downloading server utilities.  is in accounts pane.  seems quite easy to create a group and assign users (from GUI users only) to them
all preference panes more streamlined, often fitting on one screen now.  except that a lot of the functionality for some things, like network settings, must be accessed in a seperate "advanced" screen
***Network
not sure about new placement of firewall settings, hopefully the appropriate firewall activates when related port opened in Networks
***Textedit
autosave feature nice, but defaults to every 30 seconds.  Items on desktop then refresh their icon every 30 seconds.
search highlighting is nifty, caches eye quite well.  should highlight all occurrences and keep highlight on for a while so you can see them while perusing document
***spotlight
must reindex everything
***install
takes forever, much longer than it should.  the dvd media verification really took forever in itself, though I figured I should run it through for the first go.  xcode install takes quite forever itself, not done through normal installer.
preserved many, though not all, of my preferences that have corresponding preferences in the new system
***Safari
so slow.  pages take noticably longer to load.  app itself slow.  has improved greatly after several uses
some pages functionality broken.  my online banking doesn't work
bookmarks menu - submenu items pop into awful places, sometimes covering up the items below the parent so you can't continue to the rest of menu, can't access items it covers without closing entire menu and starting over
return doesn't allow editing of bookmark names as it does items in finder, elsewhere
find much nicer, inline bar at top doesn't open popup, highlights items brightly, highlights all occurrences, should highlight all brightly (only does one at a time)
javascript seems much faster, at least to select all comments for deletion in wordpress

***iCal
noticeable problem, info pane seems to have been removed.  get info by double clicking which brings up small popup near item.  not as readable. 
-not nearly as quick for people like me who leave the info pane open.I have virtually no reason to click on an item unless I want info on it.
-opens in view mode first, must click edit button to edit or Command E
-is somewhat more concise though, leaving out extra info for items without it
must now hit return to edit name instead of double clicking.  more consistent with finder behavior, but slower
***Terminal
ls: colors no longer automatically provided with color output
>console: still works, font seems weirder, perhaps harder to read
-often has some error messages near top when first entering
-still no multiple screens
less: new less much slower, does weirrd scrolling thing
***etc
quicksilver dock icon appears now
drop shadow seems more significant, makes things look further behind current window
computer runs hotter it seems
computer runs noticably slower overall.  
inconsistencies continue in command keys used in different applications, often unintuitive and arbitrary.  Command L in AddressBook and Command E in iCal edit entries.
