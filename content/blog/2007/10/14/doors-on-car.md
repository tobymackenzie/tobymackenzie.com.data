Doors on car
============

I don't know why I didn't write this before.  Perhaps I've just lost interest in this site because of the lack of people viewing it.  Anyway, I have finally gotten new doors on my car.  I came home from my trip to New York late July to find my Uncle Al had replaced the doors for me.  $130 and he did the hard part for me.  I am very happy with the results, and thank him for the surprise.  I owe him one.

For those of you who hadn't seen my car before, both front doors were in awful shape.  The mirrors were missing on both sides, making backing up and lane changing more of a pain.  The cops didn't like the lack either, and they contributed to my getting pulled over at least thrice.  The passenger side door wouldn't open at all (in fact, Uncle Al had to cut it to get it off).  The drivers side door wouldn't close as it was supposed to.  I had to tie it closed to the column to prevent it from swinging open, thus making both it and the door behind it for all intents and purposes unopenable as well.  So I had to climb through the passenger side rear door.  It was quite a pain, especially when driving other people.  And finally, both doors were very rusted out at the bottom, and the metal was bending upwards, looking rather unsightly.

I am very happy that I can back up my car and view behind me much more easily now.  Not having to climb into the car is a lot easier as well.  A lot.  I'm much less reluctant to drive others places now as well.

I had said of this summer that I'd get new doors or a new car.  I'm glad the cheaper option worked out.  I hope this car can last till I can find a diesel or electric car to replace it.
