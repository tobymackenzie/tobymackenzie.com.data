back on mac os x
================

I guess I forgot to mention it, but my server is back to running the mac os, and it has been for a good while now.  My brother had sent the install DVD finally.  I erased the old partition and installed the OS cleanly, then copied over my files from backup, which I'm glad I've finally been doing.  Of course, I could have backed them all up before wiping the drive in this instance, but it could have been worse, and there may have been some file corruption of some sort.

Unfortunately, I forgot to backup some of the files that weren't in my home folder.  Mainly game related stuff.  I lost nearly my entire collection of video game ROMs, which I've been having trouble finding now.  I also lost some game saves, including some EVN ones that I had spent some time setting up.  This has led me to start doing an occasional backup of the entire boot drive.  This was made possible by my purchase of a 120GB drive.

I have recently purchased a new computer for use for myself.  This one will become server only.  I may take it back to linux once again for less overhead and what not.  The new computer is just an updated version of my iBook G3, an iBook G4.  It will be nice to again be able to take my computer elsewhere without taking down the server.
