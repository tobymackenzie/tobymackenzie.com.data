homesteading wiki
=================

The contents of this wiki would be a guide to do basically everything you need to do around the home, with all those tips you frequently hear about aggregated in one easy to find location.  Will try to find the best way to do things.  Acknowledging that different people have different needs for the same home tasks, sections will provide all the best methods for different situations and reasons why that method would be chosen over another.

All people would be able to edit a talk page for each actual page, like a forum on that topic.  The community will decide together what should go in the article, and the editor(s) will then commit them to the actual article.
