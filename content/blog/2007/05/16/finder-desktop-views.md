finder desktop views
====================

similar to desktop paging type applications - these allow you to switch between several 'desktops' each with a set of windows or designated applications.  This would be like the ability to save these desktops, but including the ability to include windows in a 'desktop' view that might be visible in other desktop views as well. 

one would have a large collection of views, that, upon opening, would launch requisite applications and open windows, possibly moving them to certain positions, and possibly filling them with certain contents (such as a certain finder directory or the last edited project file), and hiding all other windows.  One could quickly switch between these as in normal desktop paging.  One could leave multiple open, or quit some.  When quitting a view, all windows in it are closed, and the applications involved in that are quit if they are not open in another view (a la adding to and removing from a retain count).

due to the nature of these views, there will be many more to choose from than would be in a normal desktop paging system.  Therefore, a different access method would be good.  I'd propose a list accessible via button and keyboard shortcut.  When opened, this menu would work like a normal menu, but all keypresses would enter into a search field and would work to narrow the list items via a search through it.  All currently open view items would be highlighted in some way, and could be filtered into this list.  One could also quit all open views.  This would then open the default view, likely a finder one with windows or just a view of the desktop.

in using a computer, there are many different sets of tasks that a user might perform.  some or many of these tasks might cause the use of a certain set of windows, perhaps even setting them into a certain pattern for ideal use.  They often span multiple applications, so that a single application properly sorting its windows would not be sufficient.

stub, sorry I'm tired, I will have to revise this jumble later.
