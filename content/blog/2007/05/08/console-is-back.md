>console is back
================

Hey hey, it's back.  For quite some time I would boot OS X into 'console' only when not in need of GUI type stuff.  At some point in the OS updates, around perhaps 10.4.3, this stopped working, I believe because of a security risk related to it.  Once installing that update, I haven't used that capability, until just recently.  I don't know when it happened, but I currently have 10.4.9, and it works perfectly.  I hadn't noticed before, but doing this leaves all windowserver related processes turned off, so all of that memory is freed.  To get back to the GUI, typing exit will bring you to the normal login window.  I am quite happy.  I am posting this from in >console right now, with lynx.  Unfortunately, lynx isn't very nice for posting in wordpress.  I may have to clean up this post later with a GUI.
