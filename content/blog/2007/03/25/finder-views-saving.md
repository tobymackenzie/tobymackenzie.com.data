finder views saving
===================

The list view of the finder is good for looking at information about files.  I use the column view for browsing, as it shows the hierarchy better and is faster to use, but for information I list.  I find myself frequently changing the view settings of a window in list view depending on the information I am interested in.  I might want to calculate folder sizes and sort by folder size to see where all my disk space is used.  I might want to look at the comments field to see what I've said about the files.  I don't always want the processing power usage to calculate folder sizes or the screen real estate of all these columns viewable at once.  It's a pain to set these list views up each time.  The dsStore files will save the settings for a single folder, but in general I'd want these settings the same for all folders.  All folders contain files and folders, and I have similar information to view about all of them.

I think one should be able to save a view setup that can be applied to any window.  Setting a window to the view should be simple, such as with a submenu off the list view menu item, a small menu icon somewhere on the window, and/or a contextual menu.  They'd simply have user designated names preferably describing their function.  This all would become much more relevant if the list view could have columns with other metadata, such as author, status, or owner.
