PHP is a server-side programming language focused on the web, often used to build web pages dynamically for web sites.  It is free and open sourced and has been around since the mid-90s, which is why I got into it.  It is my primary server-side programming language.  It has its problems but is overall quite nice, capable, and easy, and has been getting more features and polish over time.  I use it for both the software running websites and for various scripts I use for building and managing them and for using computers in general.  I make use of composer, Symfony, and sometimes WordPress, among other third party software built in PHP.
