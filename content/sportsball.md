I kinda like sportsball.  I liked playing as a kid, including dodgeball, cycling, basketball, soccer, tennis, ping-pong, putt-putt, bowling, and running, in a not-particularly competitive fashion.  I'm probably too old for most of that now.

I've also, at times, liked watching some sports, though it can be stressful.  I'm mostly only interested in Cleveland or Ohio teams, such as: Guardians / Indians, Caveliers, Browns (eh), and Blue Jackets.  My parents and brother like watching sportsball, so it is something I do with them.
