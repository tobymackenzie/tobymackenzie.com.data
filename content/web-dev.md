I am a web developer, making websites for a living.  I do contract work for [Cogneato](http://cogneato.com) in Akron, Ohio, where I do full stack development, including front- and back-end LAMP stack development, basic server administration, and other tasks.  I also develop things as a hobby and occasionally for other clients.  Once a year, I work on a site (or two) at [GiveCamp](http://clevelandgivecamp.org/).

I enjoy web development and am particularly interested in build processes and code organization.  I have some level of interest in most areas of the web field though.  I try to keep up to date with the never-ending stream of information, tools, options, and news.

At Cogneato, I started out mostly doing front-end development, cutting up layouts and converting them to HTML and CSS, but ended up just as much involved with back end development and server maintenance.  I work with and on the company's proprietary CMS to create and maintain websites for many businesses and organizations of varying sizes.
