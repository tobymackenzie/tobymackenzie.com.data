I am a web developer, making websites for a living.  I do contract work for [Cogneato](http://cogneato.com) in Akron, Ohio, where I do full stack development, including front- and back-end LAMP stack development, basic server administration, and other tasks.  I also develop things as a hobby and occasionally for other clients.  Once a year, I work on a site (or two) at [GiveCamp](http://clevelandgivecamp.org/).

I enjoy web development and am particularly interested in build processes and code organization.  I have some level of interest in most areas of the web field though.  I try to keep up to date with the never-ending stream of information, tools, options, and news.

At Cogneato, I started out mostly doing front-end development, cutting up layouts and converting them to HTML and CSS, but ended up just as much involved with back end development and server maintenance.  I work with and on the company's proprietary CMS to create and maintain websites for many businesses and organizations of varying sizes.  Examples include:

- [Akron Art Museum](http://akronartmuseum.org/)
- [Domokur](http://domokur.com/)
- [Citiview](http://thecitiview.com/cleveland/)
- [ALP Leaders](https://alpleaders.org/)
- [Tuesday Musical](http://tuesdaymusical.org/)
- [Summit Reworks](http://summitreworks.com/)
- [Ron White Art](http://ronwhiteart.com/)
- [Gearstar](https://gearstar.com/)
- [JeanMarie](https://shopjeanmarie.com/)

I've also worked on a handful of phone applications using PhoneGap.  The most notable would be a voting application for [High Arts Festival](https://higharts.org/) (see [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downtownakron.akronartprize) or [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id907548937)).

I frequently am working in/with:

- [PHP](http://php.net/)
- [Symfony](http://symfony.com/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) / [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) servers
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripting
- [Apache](https://www.apache.org/)
- [HTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)
- [CSS](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/)
- [JavaScript](http://www.webplatform.org/docs/javascript)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.org)
- [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/)

To a lesser degree, I work or have worked with:

- [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)
- [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/)
- [Embark Web Kiosk](http://www.gallerysystems.com/products-and-services/web-kiosk/)
- [Adobe Fireworks](https://creative.adobe.com/products/fireworks)
- [Qooxdoo](http://qooxdoo.org/)
- [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/photoshop)
- Classic ASP with VB
- SQL Server
- [XML](http://www.w3.org/XML/) / [XSL](http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/)
- [Microsoft Excel](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel)

You can see some of my personal code in [my github repos](https://github.com/tobymackenzie?tab=repositories).  Examples include a [JavaScript class system](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/js-tmclasses) and [library / codebase](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/Web-ClientBehavior), and a [Symfony project starting point](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/Symfony-Initial) and [helper bundle](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/Symfony-BaseBundle).  These are not to a stable point, but I do use the JS stuff for projects at Cogneato.
