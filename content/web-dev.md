Web developer
=============

I am a web developer, making websites for a living.  I work for [Cogneato](http://cogneato.com) in Akron, Ohio, where I do full stack development, including front- and back-end LAMP stack development, basic server administration, and other tasks.  I also develop web things as a hobby and occasionally for other clients.  I have also worked many years on non-profit sites at [GiveCamp](http://clevelandgivecamp.org/).

I enjoy web development and am particularly interested in development processes and code organization.  I have some level of interest in most areas of the web field though.

At Cogneato, I started out mostly doing front-end development, converting pictures of layouts into HTML and CSS, but ended up just as much involved with back end development and server maintenance.  I work with and on the company's proprietary CMS to create and maintain websites for many businesses and organizations of varying sizes.
