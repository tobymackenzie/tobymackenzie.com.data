Chester was Jamie and Tiffany's dog, a big orange pit mix.  He was as friendly as could be, very passive.  He loved lying on the couch and was somewhat lazy most of the time.  He loved comfort and didn't like camping, for instance, where he couldn't go back to his beloved couch.  Chester usually didn't like taking long walks.  He was very good and wouldn't wander away or be bad often at all.  He would occasionally eat tissues.

He liked to eat and would wolf down his food.  He would eat lots of things.  Once he ate a corn cob (as in the whole cob) and had to go to the hospital to get it surgically removed because it got stuck in his intestines.

He got cancer and had a big growth on the side of his face near the end.  He was having trouble breathing and they had to put him down, which they found very hard.

Chester was a very good dog.
