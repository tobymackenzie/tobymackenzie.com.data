I like dogs.  They are mostly good, mostly friendly animals.  They offer good companionship and I'm not generally allergic to them.  They can be smart as animals go and emotionally available.  They can occassionally be mean and cause trouble though.  They need more attention and time than other animals as pets as they are very social and generally need to go outside to go to the bathroom.  My family and roommates have had a number of dogs in my life.  Here are some of the important ones:
