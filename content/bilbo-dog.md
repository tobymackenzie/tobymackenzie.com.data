Bilbo was our family dog during my middle and high school years into college.  He was our first dog since I was very young.  We were very excited to get him, picked him out from a litter at the old shelter location on Quick Road.  He was a small to medium sized black dog with brown highlights with longish hair, a mix of some sort.  We named him after the character from The Hobbit:  The Rankin-Bass cartoon version was well loved by us kids.

He absolutely loved to run out of his yard and explore the neighborhood, especially when young.  Us chasing after him made him want to run farther.  We spent much time chasing him in those days.

He chewed up a lot of things he wasn't supposed to when he was young.  I still have some hats and stuff that I wasn't willing to throw away that bear his mark.

As he got older he became weaker and prone to falling.  He fell off the towpath into the adjacent water once and I had to go down in and help get him out.  He fell into a small ravine once walking him down my parents' street.  It was too steep for me so I had to help him up pulling on the leash.

He made it to a fairly old age and passed away some years ago.

He was a good dog.
